Yellow highlight | Page: 3
Many of us spontaneously anticipate how friends and colleagues will evaluate our choices; the quality and content of these anticipated judgments therefore matters.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 5
we were far too willing to believe research findings based on inadequate evidence and prone to collect too few observations in our own research.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 6
Amos was the more logical thinker, with an orientation to theory and an unfailing sense of direction.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 6
I was more intuitive and rooted in the psychology of perception, from which we borrowed many ideas.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 7
Did it occur to you that there are more than 20 male farmers for each male librarian in the United States? Because there are so many more farmers, it is almost certain that more “meek and tidy” souls will be found on tractors than at library information desks.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 7
The reliance on the heuristic caused predictable biases (systematic errors) in their predictions.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 7
We called this reliance on the ease of memory search the availability heuristic.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 8
Our article challenged both assumptions without discussing them directly. We documented systematic errors in the thinking of normal people, and we traced these errors to the design of the machinery of cognition rather than to the corruption of thought by

emotion.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 8
People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory—and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 12
When the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available, intuition still has a shot: an answer may come to mind quickly—but it is not an answer to the original question. The question that the executive faced (should I invest in Ford stock?) was difficult, but the answer to an easier and related question (do I like Ford cars?) came readily to his mind and determined his choice.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 12
This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 28
Our teacher took it for granted that the sympathy we would feel for the patient would not be under our control; it would arise from System 1.

The Invisible Gorilla had

you would be more likely to select the tempting chocolate cake when your mind is loaded with digits.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 41
Another way of saying this is that controlling thoughts and behaviors is one of the tasks that System 2 performs.

Yellow highlight | Page: 46
Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 48
children’s ability to control their attention and their ability to control their emotions.

judgment? Stanovich published his conclusions in a book titled Rationality and the Reflective Mind,
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 51
The word evokes memories, which evoke emotions, which in turn evoke facial expressions and other reactions, such as a general tensing up and an avoidance tendency.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 51
yielding a self-reinforcing pattern of cognitive, emotional, and physical responses that is both diverse and integrated—it has been called associatively coherent.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 51
cognition is embodied; you think with your body, not only with your brain.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 52
David Hume reduced the principles of association to three: resemblance, contiguity in time and place, and causality.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 52
effects (virus cold); things to their properties (lime green); things to the categories
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 52
exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 52
We call this a priming effect
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 53
your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 53
influencing of an action by the idea—is known as the ideomotor effect.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 54
if you were primed to think of old age, you would tend to act old, and acting old would reinforce the thought of old age.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 54
Reciprocal links are common in the associative network.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 54
you are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 55
funding of schools was significantly greater when the polling station was in a school than when it was in a nearby location.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 55
The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 57
But your subjective experience consists largely of the story that your System 2 tells itself about what is going on. Priming phenomena arise in System 1, and you have no conscious access to them.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 58
Evidently, a purely symbolic reminder of being watched prodded people into improved behavior.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 58
Timothy Wilson wrote a book with the evocative title Strangers to Ourselves. You have now been introduced to that stranger in you, which may be in control of much of what you do, although you rarely have a glimpse of it. System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs,
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 58
“His System 1 constructed a story, and his System 2 believed it. It happens to all of us.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 58
“I made myself smile and I’m actually feeling better!”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 59
The surprise is that a single dial of cognitive ease is connected to a large network of diverse inputs and outputs. Figure 5 tells the story.

“Becoming Famous Overnight.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 61
greater cognitive ease in perceiving a word you have seen earlier, and it is this sense of ease that gives you the impression of familiarity.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 61
pointing one way or another. You knew soon after reading them that the first two statements are true and the last one is false. Note, however, that the statement “A chicken has three legs” is more obviously false than “A chicken has four legs.” Your associative machinery slows the judgment of the latter
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 62
But there were questions where no good answer came to mind, where all I had to go by was cognitive ease.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 62
The impression of familiarity is produced by System 1, and System 2 relies on that impression for a true/false judgment.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 62
A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 62
distinguished from truth.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 62
true. It is entirely legitimate for you to enlist cognitive ease to work in your favor,
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 63
If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 63
complex language where simpler language will do.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 65
performance was better with the bad font. Cognitive strain, whatever its source, mobilizes System 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 66
it. Zajonc called it the mere exposure effect.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 67
Indeed, the mere exposure effect is actually stronger for stimuli that the individual never consciously sees.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 67
The link between positive emotion and cognitive ease in System 1 has a long evolutionary history.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 67
creativity is associative memory that works
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 67
exceptionally well.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 69
Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 69
when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 70
“I’m in a very good mood today, and my System 2 is weaker than usual. I should be extra careful.”

Yellow highlight | Page: 73
“How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 74
violations of normality are detected with astonishing speed and subtlety.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 76
We are evidently ready from birth to have impressions of causality, which do not depend on reasoning about patterns of causation. They are products of System 1.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 82
The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person—including things you have not observed—is known as the halo effect.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 85
A simple rule can help: before an issue is discussed, all members of the committee should be asked to write a very brief summary of their position.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 90
Good mood and cognitive ease are the human equivalents of assessments of safety and familiarity.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 98
Substituting one question for another can be a good strategy for solving difficult problems, and George Pólya included substitution in his classic How to Solve It: “If you can’t solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve:

Only visual artists and experienced photographers have developed the skill of seeing the drawing as an object on the page.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 101
You were not confused about the question, but you were influenced by the answer to a question that you were not asked: “How tall are the three people?”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 103
Paul Slovic has proposed an affect heuristic in which people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 103
attitudes, however, System 2 is more of an apologist for the emotions of System 1 than a critic of those emotions—an endorser rather than an enforcer. Its search
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 106
overweights low probabilities
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 111
Just as in the game of Jack and Jill, extreme outcomes (very high and/or very low cancer rates) are most likely to be found in sparsely populated counties. This is all there is to the story.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 111
they are what scientists call artifacts, observations that are produced entirely by some aspect of the method of research—in this case, by differences in sample size.

but they were wrong: the anchoring effect was 41%.

Yellow highlight | Page: 127
focuses his attention on the minimal offer that the opponent would accept, or on the costs to the opponent of failing to reach an agreement. In general, a strategy of deliberately “thinking the opposite” may be a good defense against anchoring effects, because it negates the biased recruitment of thoughts that produces these
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 132
the number of instances retrieved the ease with which they come to mind
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 132
The contest yielded a clear-cut winner: people who had just listed twelve instances rated themselves as less assertive than people who had listed only six.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 132
Self-ratings were dominated by the ease with which examples had come to mind.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 132
As you already know, frowning normally accompanies cognitive strain and the effect is symmetric: when people are instructed to frown while doing a task, they actually try harder and
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 133
experience greater cognitive strain.

availability bias.

As expected, the students who listed more ways to improve the class rated it higher!

“unexplained unavailability” heuristic.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 134
When the surprise is eliminated, low fluency no longer influences the judgment.

Merely reminding people of a time when they had power increases their apparent trust in their own intuition.

availability bias.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 136
“The CEO has had several successes in a row, so failure doesn’t come easily to her mind. The availability bias is making her overconfident.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 140
finding was that people who had received a message extolling the benefits of a technology also changed their beliefs about its risks.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 140
Paul Slovic probably knows more about the peculiarities of human judgment of risk than any other individual.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 140
inadequately sensitive to differences between low and negligibly low probabilities.

genuine conflict of values.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 141
Human beings have invented the concept of “risk” to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of life.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 142
cascade. They comment that in the social context, “all heuristics are equal, but availability is more equal than the others.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 142
An availability cascade is a self-sustaining chain of events, which may start from media reports of a relatively minor event and lead up to public panic and large-scale government action. On some occasions, a media story about a risk catches the attention of a segment of the public, which becomes aroused and worried. This emotional reaction becomes a story in itself, prompting additional coverage in the media, which in turn produces greater concern and involvement.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 143
The Alar tale illustrates a basic limitation in the ability of our mind to deal with small risks: we either ignore them altogether or give them far too much weight—nothing in between.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 144
Sunstein has coined the phrase “probability neglect” to describe the pattern.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 144
insulating the experts from the emotions of the public produces policies that the public will

When the evidence is weak, one should stick with the base rates.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 158
The word fallacy is used, in general, when people fail to apply a logical rule that is obviously relevant.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 174
Subjects’ unwillingness to deduce the particular from the general was matched only by their willingness to infer the general from the particular.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 174
You are more likely to learn something by finding surprises in your own behavior than by hearing surprising facts about people in general.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 176
The instructor had attached a causal interpretation to the inevitable fluctuations of a random process.

we are statistically punished for being nice and rewarded for being nasty.

mind is strongly biased toward causal explanations and does not deal well with “mere statistics.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 183
extreme groups regress to the mean over time. The correlation
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 183
mistake—confusing mere correlation with causation.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 184
“She says experience has taught her that criticism is more effective than praise. What she doesn’t understand is that it’s all due to regression to the mean.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 199
The explanatory stories that people find compelling are simple; are concrete rather than abstract; assign a larger role to talent, stupidity, and intentions than to luck; and focus on a few striking events that happened rather than on the countless events that failed to happen.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 199
we humans constantly fool ourselves by constructing flimsy accounts of the past and believing they are true.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 199
The halo effect helps keep explanatory narratives simple and coherent by exaggerating the consistency of evaluations:
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 201
our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 201
we apply the word know only when what was known is true and can be shown to be true. We can know something only if it is both true and knowable.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 202
A general limitation of the human mind is its imperfect ability to reconstruct past states of knowledge, or beliefs that have changed.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 204
The sense-making machinery of System 1 makes us see the world as more tidy, simple, predictable, and coherent than it really is.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 206
In his penetrating book The Halo Effect, Philip Rosenzweig,
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 206
consistently exaggerate the impact of leadership style and management practices on firm outcomes, and thus their message is rarely useful.

halo. The CEO of a successful company is likely to be called flexible, methodical, and decisive.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 206
confused, rigid, and authoritarian.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 206
The halo effect and outcome bias combine to explain the extraordinary appeal of books that seek to draw operational morals from systematic examination of successful businesses.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 207
good managerial practices can be identified and that good practices will be rewarded by good results. Both messages are overstated.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 207
Because luck plays a large role, the quality of leadership and management practices cannot be inferred reliably from observations of success. And even if you had perfect foreknowledge that a CEO has brilliant vision and

“Most Admired Companies” finds that over a twenty-year period, the firms with the worst ratings went on to earn much higher stock returns than the most admired firms.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 207
regression to the mean.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 207
Stories of how businesses rise and fall strike a chord with readers by offering what the human mind needs: a simple message of triumph and failure that identifies clear causes and ignores the determinative power of luck and the inevitability of regression.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 208
“Let’s not fall for the outcome bias. This was a stupid decision even though it worked out well.”

clear instance of substitution, and of the representativeness heuristic in particular.

showed, people are often reluctant to infer the particular from the general.

Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it.

confidence mainly tell you that an individual has constructed a coherent story in his mind, not necessarily that the story is true.

Yellow highlight | Page: 213
does? For most of them, that belief is an illusion.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 213
Everybody in the investment business has read Burton Malkiel’s wonderful book A Random Walk Down Wall Street. Malkiel’s central idea is that a stock’s price incorporates all the available knowledge about the value of the company and the best predictions about the future of the stock.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 215
The results resembled what you would expect from a dice-rolling contest, not a game of skill.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 216
The illusion of skill is not only an individual aberration; it is deeply ingrained in the culture of the industry.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 216
Facts that challenge such basic assumptions—and thereby threaten people’s livelihood and self-esteem—are simply not absorbed.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 217
it is not surprising that large numbers of individuals in that world believe themselves to be among the chosen few who can do what they believe others cannot.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 219
Even in the region they knew best, experts were not significantly better than nonspecialists.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 219
But those with the most knowledge are often less reliable.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 219
The reason is that the person who acquires more knowledge develops an enhanced illusion of her skill and becomes unrealistically overconfident.

They are dazzled by their own brilliance and hate to be wrong.

Hedgehogs “know one big thing” and have a theory about the world; they account for particular events within a coherent framework, bristle with impatience toward those who don’t see things their way, and are confident in their forecasts.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 220
Foxes, by contrast, are complex thinkers. They don’t believe that one big thing drives the march of history

The second is that high subjective confidence is not to be trusted as an indicator of accuracy

Because of the possibility effect, we tend to overweight small risks and are willing to pay far more than expected value to eliminate them
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 312
The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle. Improbable outcomes are overweighted—this is the possibility effect. Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty. The expectation principle, by which values are weighted by their probability, is poor psychology.

there is a powerful argument that a decision maker who wishes to be rational must conform to the expectation principle.

However, when an unlikely event becomes the focus of attention, we will assign it much more weight than its probability deserves.

people attach values to gains and losses rather than to wealth, and the decision weights that they assign to outcomes are different from probabilities.

This is where people who face very bad options take desperate gambles, accepting a high probability of making things worse in exchange for a small hope of avoiding a large loss. Risk taking of this kind often turns manageable failures into disasters.

Overweighting of unlikely outcomes is rooted in System 1 features that are familiar by

Your judgment of probability was ultimately determined by the cognitive ease, or fluency, with which a plausible scenario came to mind.

Aside from containing what may be my favorite ad-lib, the above dialogue illustrates a fundamental theme of this book: Very often in making a decision about someone or something, we don’t use all the relevant available information; we use, instead, only a single, highly representative piece of the total.

“What do you do on days when it isn’t going well?” Dr. Brock was asked. He said he just stopped writing and put the work aside for a day when it would go better. I then said that the professional writer must establish a daily schedule and stick to it. I said that writing is a craft, not an art, and that the man who runs away from his craft because he lacks inspiration is fooling himself. He is also going broke.

There are all kinds of writers and all kinds of methods, and any method that helps you to say what you want to say is the right method for you. Some people write by day, others by night. Some people need silence, others turn on the radio. Some write by hand, some by computer, some by talking into a tape recorder. Some people write their first draft in one long burst and then revise; others can’t write the second paragraph until they have fiddled endlessly with the first.

Ultimately the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is. I often find myself reading with interest about a topic I never thought would interest me—some scientific quest, perhaps. What holds me is the enthusiasm of the writer for his field. How was he drawn into it? What emotional baggage did he bring along? How did it change his life? It’s not necessary to want to spend a year alone at Walden Pond to become involved with a writer who did.

Readers want the person who is talking to them to sound genuine. Therefore a fundamental rule is: be yourself.

Assume that you are the writer sitting down to write. You think your article must be of a certain length or it won’t seem important. You think how august it will look in print. You think of all the people who will read it. You think that it must have the solid weight of authority. You think that its style must dazzle. No wonder you tighten; you are so busy thinking of your awesome responsibility to the finished article that you can’t even start. Yet you vow to be worthy of the task, and, casting about for grand phrases that wouldn’t occur to you if you weren’t trying so hard to make an impression, you plunge in.

at least think “I” while you write, or write the first draft in the first person and then take the “I”s out. It will warm up your impersonal style.

Sell yourself, and your subject will exert its own appeal. Believe in your own identity and your own opinions. Writing is an act of ego, and you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep yourself going.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 418
Think of the other as a creative act: the expressing of who you are. Relax and say what you want to say. And since style is who you are, you only need to be true to yourself to find it gradually emerging from under the accumulated clutter and debris, growing more distinctive every day.

Never say anything in writing that you wouldn’t comfortably say in conversation. If you’re not a person who says “indeed” or “moreover,” or who calls someone an individual (“he’s a fine individual”), please don’t write it.

There is a kind of writing that might be called journalese, and it’s the death of freshness in anybody’s style. It’s the common currency of newspapers and of magazines like People—a mixture of cheap words, made-up words and clichés that have become so pervasive that a writer can hardly help using them. You must fight these phrases or you’ll sound like every hack.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 512
What is “journalese”? It’s a quilt of instant words patched together out of other parts of speech. Adjectives are used as nouns (“greats,” “notables”). Nouns are used as verbs (“to host”), or they are chopped off to form verbs (“enthuse,” “emote”), or they are padded to form verbs (“beef up,” “put teeth into”). This is a world where eminent people are “famed” and their associates are “staffers,” where the future is always “upcoming” and someone is forever “firing off” a note.

Make a habit of reading what is being written today and what was written by earlier masters. Writing is learned by imitation. If anyone asked me how I learned to write, I’d say I learned by reading the men and women who were doing the kind of writing I wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it. But cultivate the best models. Don’t assume that because an article is in a newspaper or a magazine it must be good.

instance, and you’ll be awash in such rascality as only a lexicographer could conjure back from centuries of iniquity, obliquity, depravity, knavery, profligacy, frailty, flagrancy, infamy, immorality, corruption, wickedness, wrongdoing, backsliding and sin. You’ll find ruffians and riffraff, miscreants and malefactors, reprobates and rapscallions, hooligans and hoodlums, scamps and scapegraces, scoundrels and scalawags, jezebels and jades. You’ll find adjectives to fit them all (foul and fiendish, devilish and diabolical), and adverbs and verbs to describe how the wrongdoers do their wrong, and cross-references leading to still other thickets of venality and vice. Still, there’s no better friend to have around to nudge the memory than Roget. It saves you the time of rummaging in your brain—that network of overloaded grooves—to find the word that’s right on the tip of your tongue, where it doesn’t do you any good. The Thesaurus is to the writer

I try to surmise how in rewriting the sentence he reassembled it to end with a phrase that will momentarily linger, or how he chose one word over another because he was after a certain emotional weight.

If you went to work for a newspaper that required you to write two or three articles every day, you would be a better writer after six months. You wouldn’t necessarily be writing well; your style might still be full of clutter and clichés.

All writing is ultimately a question of solving a problem. It may be a problem of where to obtain the facts or how to organize the material. It may be a problem of approach or attitude, tone or style. Whatever it is, it has to be confronted and solved. Sometimes you will despair of finding the right solution—or any solution. You’ll think, “If I live to be ninety I’ll never get out of this mess.” I’ve often thought it myself. But when I finally do solve the problem it’s because I’m like a surgeon removing his 500th appendix; I’ve been there before.

Unity is the anchor of good writing. So, first, get your unities straight. Unity not only keeps the reader from straggling off in all directions; it satisfies your readers’ subconscious need for order and reassures them that all is well at the helm.

Instead of controlling his material, his material is controlling him.

Therefore ask yourself some basic questions before you start. For example: “In what capacity am I going to address the reader?” (Reporter? Provider of information? Average man or woman?) “What pronoun and tense am I going to use?” “What style?” (Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and casual?) “What attitude am I going to take toward the material?” (Involved? Detached? Judgmental? Ironic? Amused?) “How much do I want to cover?” “What one point do I want to make?”

Readers want to know—very soon—what’s in it for them.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 795
Therefore your lead must capture the reader immediately and force him to keep reading. It must cajole him with freshness, or novelty, or paradox, or humor, or surprise, or with an unusual idea, or an interesting fact, or a question. Anything will do, as long as it nudges his curiosity and tugs at his sleeve.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 797
Next the lead must do some real work. It must provide hard details that tell the reader why the piece was written and why he ought to read it. But don’t dwell on the reason. Coax the reader a little more; keep him inquisitive.

Once upon a time really smart people were completely convinced the world was flat. Then they learned that it wasn’t. But they were still pretty sure the sun revolved around the Earth … until that theory went bust, too. For an even longer period of time, smart people have believed story is just a form of entertainment. They’ve thought that beyond the immense pleasure it bestows—the ephemeral joy and deep sense of satisfaction a good story leaves us with—story itself serves no necessary purpose. Sure, our lives from time immemorial would have been far drabber without it, but we’d have survived just fine. Wrong again.

Story, as it turns out, was crucial to our evolution—more so than opposable thumbs. Opposable thumbs let us hang on; story told us what to hang on
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 1
Story is what enabled us to imagine what might happen in the future, and so prepare for it—a feat no other species can lay claim to, opposable thumbs or not.1 Story is what makes us human, not just metaphorically but literally. Recent breakthroughs in neuroscience reveal that our brain is hardwired to respond to story; the pleasure we derive from a tale well told is nature’s way of seducing us into paying attention to it.2

Yellow highlight | Page: 3
Why do writers often have trouble embracing the notion that there is more to creating a story than having a good idea and a way with words? Because the ease with which we surrender to the stories we read tends to cloud our understanding of stories we write.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 4
Evolution dictates that the first job of any good story is to completely anesthetize the part of our brain that questions how it is creating such a compelling illusion of reality.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 4
So it’s no surprise that we tend to be utterly oblivious to the fact that beneath every captivating story, there is an intricate mesh of interconnected elements holding it together, allowing it to build with seemingly effortless precision. This often fools us into thinking we know exactly what has us hooked—things like beautiful metaphors, authentic-sounding dialogue, an interesting character—when, in fact, despite how engaging those things appear to be in and of themselves, it turns out they’re secondary. What has us hooked is something else altogether, something that underlies them, secretly bringing them to life: story, as our brain understands it.

It’s simple. Your brain, along with every other living organism down to the humble amoeba, has one main goal: survival.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 6
Your subconscious brain—which neuroscientists refer to as the adaptive or cognitive unconscious—is a finely tuned instrument, instantly aware of what matters, what doesn’t, why, and, hopefully, what you should do about it.2 It knows you don’t have the time to think,

“Gee, what’s that loud noise? Oh, it’s a horn honking; it must be coming from that great big SUV that’s barreling straight at me. The driver was probably texting and didn’t notice me until it was too late to stop. Maybe I should get out of the—” Splat.

Our brain developed a way to consciously navigate information so that, provided we have the time, we can decide on our own what to do next.

Story. Here’s how neuroscientist Antonio Damasio sums it up: “The problem of how to make all this wisdom understandable, transmissible, persuasive, enforceable—in a word, of how to make it stick—was faced and a solution found. Storytelling was the solution—storytelling is something brains do, naturally and implicitly.… [I]t should be no surprise that it pervades the entire fabric of human societies and cultures.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 8
We think in story. It’s hardwired in our brain. It’s how we make strategic sense of the otherwise overwhelming world around us. Simply put, the brain constantly seeks meaning from all the input thrown at it, yanks out what’s important for our survival on a need-to-know basis, and tells us a story about it, based on what it knows of our past experience with it, how we feel about it, and how it might affect us. Rather than recording everything on a first come, first served basis, our brain casts us as “the protagonist” and then edits our experience with cinema-like precision, creating logical interrelations, mapping connections between memories, ideas, and events for future reference.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 8
Story is the language of experience,
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 9
Story evolved as a way to explore our own mind and the minds of others, as a sort of dress rehearsal for the future.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 9
As a result, story helps us survive not only in the life-and-death physical sense but also in a life-well-lived social sense.

Fictional narratives supply us with a mental catalogue of the fatal conundrums we might face someday and the outcomes of strategies we could deploy in them.

Not only do we crave story, but we have very specific hardwired expectations for every story we read,
                
Note:Story's ability to help us safely navigate in daily life.

Yellow highlight | Page: 10
The real answer is rather counterintuitive: our expectations have everything to do with the story’s ability to provide information on how we might safely navigate this earthly plane.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 10
When a story meets our brain’s criteria, we relax and slip into the protagonist’s skin, eager to experience what his or her struggle feels like, without having to leave the comfort of home.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 11
So what is a story? A story is how what happens affects someone who is trying to achieve what turns out to be a difficult goal, and how he or she changes as a result. Breaking it down in the soothingly familiar parlance of the writing world, this translates to
                
Note:What is a story

Yellow highlight | Page: 11
The “goal” is what’s known as the story question.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 11
As counterintuitive as it may sound, a story is not about the plot or even what happens in it. Stories are about how we, rather than the world around us, change. They grab us only when they allow us to experience how it would feel to navigate the plot. Thus story, as we’ll see throughout, is an internal journey, not an external one.
                
Note:***** how we change is what matters in the story

Yellow highlight | Page: 12
All the elements of a story are anchored in this very simple premise, and they work in unison to create what appears to the reader as reality, only sharper, clearer, and far more entertaining, because stories do what our cognitive unconscious does: filter out everything that would distract us from the situation at hand.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 12
Let’s face it, we’re all busy. Plus, most of us are plagued by that little voice in the back of our head constantly reminding us of what we really should be doing right now instead of whatever it is we’re actually doing—

the sense that something is about to change (and not necessarily for the better).

As neuroscience reveals, what draws us into a story and keeps us there is the firing of our dopamine neurons, signaling that intriguing information is on its way.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 14
As readers we eagerly probe each piece of information for significance, constantly wondering, “What is this meant to tell me?”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 14
We are always looking for the why beneath what’s happening on the surface. Not only because our survival might depend on it, but because it’s exhilarating. It makes us feel something—namely, curiosity. Having our curiosity piqued is visceral.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 14
the anticipation of knowledge we’re now hungry for, a sensation caused by that pleasurable rush of dopamine. Because being curious is necessary for survival (What’s that rustling in the bushes?), nature encourages it. And what better way to encourage curiosity than to make it feel good? This is why, once your curiosity is roused as a reader, you have an emotional, vested interest in finding out what happens next.

“Within the brain, things are always evaluated within a specific context.”13 It is context that bestows meaning, and it is meaning that your brain is wired to sniff out.

be. After all, unless something is already happening, how can we want to know what happens next?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 23
marketers, politicians, and televangelists know more about story than most writers. This is because, by definition, they start with something writers often never even think about—the point their story will make.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 23
Armed with that knowledge, they then craft a tale in which every word, every image, every nuance leads directly to it.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 25
Thus your first job is to zero in on the point your story is making.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 25
A story is designed, from beginning to end, to answer a single overarching question. As readers we instinctively know this, so we expect every word, every line, every character, every image, every action to move us closer to the answer.

As one editor put it, “If you can’t summarize your book in a few sentences, rewrite the book until you can.”

We have no idea who the protagonist is, so we have no way to gauge the relevance or meaning of anything that happens.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 26
We know who the protagonist is, but she doesn’t seem to have a goal, so we
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 26
don’t know what the point is or where the story is going.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 26
We know what the protagonist’s goal is, but have no clue what inner issue it forces him to deal with, so everything feels superficial and rather dull.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 26
We know who the protagonist is and what both her goal and her issue are, but suddenly she gets what she wants, arbitrarily changes her mind, or gets hit by a bus, and now someone else seems to be the main character.    • We’re aware of the protagonist’s goal, but what happens doesn’t seem to affect him or whether he achieves it.    • The things that happen don’t affect the protagonist in a believable way (if at all), so not only doesn’t she seem like a real person, but we have no idea why she does what she does, which makes it impossible to anticipate what she’ll do next.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 27
What was missing in all those failed manuscripts is focus. Without it, the reader has no way to gauge the meaning of anything, and since we’re wired to hunt for meaning in everything—well, you do the math.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 27
The story isn’t about whether or not the protagonist achieves her goal per se; it’s about what she has to overcome internally to do it. This is what drives the story forward. I call it the protagonist’s issue.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 27
The second element, the theme, is what your story says about human nature.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 27
Theme tends to be reflected in how your characters treat each other, so it defines what is possible and what isn’t in the world the story unfolds in.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 28
The third element is the plot itself—the events that relentlessly force the protagonist to deal with her issue as she pursues her goal, no matter how many times she tries to make an end run around her issue along the way.

What does the story tell us about what it means to be human?    • What does it say about how humans react to circumstances beyond their control?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 30
But the real secret to theme is that it’s not general; that is, the theme wouldn’t be “love” per se—rather, it would be a very specific point you’re making about love. For instance, a love story can be sweet and lyrical, revealing that people are good eggs after all; it can be hard-nosed and edgy, revealing that people are intense and quirky; it can be cynical and manipulative, revealing that people are best avoided, if possible.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 30
Knowing the theme of your story in advance helps, because it gives you a gauge by which to measure your characters’ responses to the situations they find themselves in.

As corporate consultants Richard Maxwell and Robert Dickman say in their book The Elements of Persuasion, “For those of us whose business depends on being able to persuade others—which is all of us in business—the key to survival is being able to cut through all the clutter and make the sale. The good news is that the secret of selling is what it has always been—a good story.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 31
Knowing your story’s point is what helps you cut through all the clutter.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 31
the instant a reader opens your book, his cognitive unconscious is hunting for a way to make life a little easier, see things a little clearer, understand people a bit better.9 So why not take a second to ask yourself, What is it I want my readers to walk away thinking about? What point does my story make? How do I want to change the way my reader sees the world?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 33
Thus we have a bird’s-eye view of the battle between the protagonist and the plot,

She was glad she had never left Henry. She’d never had a friend as loyal, as kind, as her husband. And yet, standing behind her son, waiting for the traffic light to change, she remembered how in the midst of it all there had been times when she’d felt a loneliness so deep that once, not so many years ago, having a cavity filled, the dentist’s gentle turning of her chin with his soft fingers had felt to her like a tender kindness of almost excruciating depth, and she had swallowed with a groan of longing, tears springing to her eyes.11 In that very specific memory—the dentist’s fleeting, workaday touch—an otherwise ineffable feeling of existential loneliness is made manifest, as palpable as if it had happened to us—because, as we’ll see in chapter 4, as far as our brain is concerned, it actually has. By filtering her story through the thematic lens of loss and human endurance, Strout was able to pluck an otherwise random moment from Olive’s life and use it to give us insight into how Olive sees the world, and at the same time provide a visceral glimpse of the cost of being human.

Yellow highlight | Page: 37
Good question. Here’s the litmus test: the central theme must provide a point of view precise enough to give us specific insight into the protagonist and her internal issue, yet be broad enough to take into account everything that happens (again: the plot).
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 39
is it possible to filter the story’s other themes through it?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 39
In Gone with the Wind, Scarlett’s gumption came first, so—for better or worse—it affects everything else: her love life, her refusal to be constrained by the mores of the day, and her insatiable need to take action when she doesn’t get what she wants. Take action? Ah yes, the plot.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 39
As we know, it’s the plot that puts the protagonist through his paces, presenting increasingly difficult obstacles that must be overcome if he’s to get within grabbing distance of the brass ring.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 39
But the plot’s goal isn’t simply to find out whether he snags that brass ring or not; rather, it’s to force him to confront the internal issue that’s keeping him from it in the first place. This issue is sometimes called the protagonist’s “fatal flaw,” and whether a deep-rooted fear, a stubborn misperception, or a dubious character trait, it’s what he’s been battling throughout and what he must finally overcome to have a clear shot at the last remaining obstacle.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 39
Ironically, once he overcomes it, he often realizes true success is vastly different from what, up to that very second, he thought it was.

The answer is her family’s plantation, Tara. Meaning, land. As her father tells her early on, “Land is the only thing in the world that amounts to anything.…” Land is what ties you to your past and makes you who you are. Without it, you are nothing. This becomes Scarlett’s benchmark, the thing that she’s sure will prove she’s survived.

Readers are a surprisingly accepting lot when it comes to willfully blind protagonists, provided they understand the reason for their blindness.

everything we experience is automatically coated in emotion. Why? It’s our version of a computer’s ones and zeros, and it’s based on a single question: Will it hurt me, or will it help me?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 47
This humble equation underlies every aspect of our rich, elegant, complex, and ever-changing sense of self, and how we experience the world around us. According to Damasio, “No set of conscious images of any kind on any topic ever fails to be accompanied by an obedient choir of emotions and consequent feelings.”5 If we’re not feeling, we’re not breathing. A neutral protagonist is an automaton.

It is the protagonist’s story, after all, so we evaluate everyone and everything else based on how they affect him. Because ultimately what moves a story forward are the protagonist’s actions, reactions, and decisions, rather than the external events that trigger them.

To sum up, when writing in the first person, it helps to keep these things in mind:    • Every word the narrator says must in some way reflect his point of view.    • The narrator never mentions anything that doesn’t affect him in some way.    • The narrator draws a conclusion about everything he mentions.    • The narrator is never neutral; he always has an agenda.    • The narrator can never tell us what anyone else is thinking or feeling.

This tendency drives what communication scholars Chip and Dan Heath have dubbed “the Curse of Knowledge.” They explain, “Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has ‘cursed’ us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can’t readily re-create our listeners’ state of mind.”

If you don’t provide your protagonist with a driving deep-seated need that he believes his quest will fulfill, the things that happen will feel random; they won’t add up to anything.

In It’s a Wonderful Life, George’s internal goal is to make a big difference in the world. His external goal is to get out of Bedford Falls and build bridges, skyscrapers, and to “do big things.” He believes these goals are one and the same. The movie then chronicles how his external goal is thwarted at every turn, and instead of doing big things, he always does the right thing. In the end, that’s precisely how he achieves his internal goal—making a big difference in many people’s lives—which brings with it the realization that he actually achieved his external goal as well. He did do big things—things that are far more important and enduring than building skyscrapers. Thus, by achieving his internal goal, he was able to redefine his external goal—and, happily, discover that he’d already accomplished it.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 74
But up to that moment, George fully believed that only by achieving his external goal would his internal goal be met. And as real life makes all too clear, this is rarely the case.

By defining your protagonist’s internal and external goals, and then pitting them against each other, you can often ignite the kind of external tension and internal conflict capable of driving an entire narrative.

Adding External Problems Adds Drama Only If They’re Something the Protagonist Must Confront to Overcome Her Issue The myth that external problems add drama has plagued writers from time immemorial and has been inadvertently perpetuated by the myriad versions of the “hero’s journey” story-structure model, which mandates that certain external events must happen at certain specific points in a story.

crafting protagonists whose internal progress depends on said events occurring.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Such stories are written from the outside in: the writers throw dramatic obstacles in their protagonist’s path because the timeline tells them to rather than because they’re part of an organic, escalating scenario that forces the protagonist to confront her inner issue. Thus the dramatic events aren’t spawned by the story itself but by an external by-the-numbers story-structure formula.

Because we had no clue what her specific desires, fears, or needs were beyond the very obvious one-dimensional need to get out of the current situation ASAP, we couldn’t anticipate how she would react to the things that happened, except in a generic, that’s-what-any-person-would-do sense. And that, my friends, is boring. Why? Because
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 77
we all have a pretty good idea of what “any person” would do. Where’s the suspense in that? We turn to story to tell us something we don’t know. So while we don’t care a whit about what “any person” would do, we care passionately about what your protagonist would do—as long as we know why.

Having a firm understanding of what your protagonist’s specific goals and fears mean to her provides you with concrete plot guidelines.

It’s hard to understand what other people want from us. It’s hard to know what we truly want for ourselves (well, besides another piece of that salted caramel chocolate).

WHEN I WAS FIVE, I closed my eyes and thought really hard about whether I was now invisible. After all, I couldn’t see anything, so how could anyone see me? Yes, I concluded: I had indeed vanished.

Being wrong changes how we see—or don’t see—the world.

And we’re wrong a lot, partly because in order to survive, we’re wired to draw conclusions about everything we see, whether or not we have all—or any—of the facts; and partly because, more often than not, it’s our cognitive unconscious that deftly constructs the implicit beliefs that then organize and rule our world.

According to neuropsychologist Justin Barrett, our implicit or “nonreflective” beliefs are our default mode, constantly working behind the scenes to shape memory and experience.

Everyone here is so nice—I better watch my back. And the scary thing is, we don’t even know we’re doing it until something happens that proves us wrong, and suddenly our implicit belief is catapulted into our conscious mind, where we have to either deal with it or work overtime to rationalize it away.3

The best place to start working on a story is long before your poor unsuspecting protagonist shows up on page one. The best place to start is by pinpointing the moment long before, when she first fell prey to the inner issue that’s been skewing her worldview ever since.

REALITY: Character Bios Should Concentrate Solely on Information Relevant to Your Story
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 90
The same goes for writing a general from-birth-to-the-present bio. The whole point of a story is to filter out the kind of unnecessary information such bios are full of.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 91
Here’s the secret: you are looking only for information that pertains to the story you’re telling. If a story is about a problem, then what you’re looking for is the root of the problem that will blossom on page one.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 91
That’s why, when writing your protagonist’s bio, the goal is to pinpoint two things: the event in his past that knocked his worldview out of alignment, triggering the internal issue that keeps him from achieving his goal; and the inception of his desire for the goal itself.

Thus what you’re looking for when you write your character bios is the specific before that leads to the moment when suddenly everything is in flux.

“before” is the yardstick that allows the reader to measure the protagonist’s progress toward “after.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 94
“Character is action”—meaning the things we do reveal who we are, especially because, as Gazzaniga reminds us, “Our actions tend to reflect our automatic intuitive thinking or beliefs.”13 Story is often about a protagonist coming to realize what’s really causing him to do the things he does, at which point he either celebrates, because he’s better than he thought, or begins making amends, because he’s worse.

Facts that don’t affect us—either directly or because we can’t imagine how the facts affect someone else—don’t matter to us.

So if you want to write a novel that inspires people you’ve never even met to call their friends and say, “You gotta read this book,” you need to root through your story and make sure you’ve translated anything brain-numbingly vague, abstract, or generic into something that’s surprisingly specific, deliciously tangible, and grippingly visceral.

We don’t like change, and we don’t like conflict, either. So most of the time we do our best to avoid both. This isn’t easy, since the only real constant is change, and change is driven by conflict. This or that? Me or you? Chocolate or vanilla?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 126
And there’s the paradox: we survived because we’re risk takers, but our goal is to stay safe by not changing an iota unless we absolutely have to. Talk about conflict! And that brings us right back to story. Story’s job is to tackle exactly how we handle that conflict, which boils down to this: the battle between fear and desire.

Indeed, it ripples through the story in the guise of mounting tension, engendering in the reader that delicious dopamine-driven sensation we’re addicted to when it comes to a good tale: suspense, the desire to find out what’s really going on.

Since stories are about how what happens affects someone—Joe, for instance—the reason he popped the balloon is more important than the fact that he popped it. In short, the why carries more weight than the what. Think of it as a pecking order: the why comes first, because it drives the what; the why is the cause; the what is the effect.

it’s about why. The internal, story-level cause-and-effect trajectory tracks the evolution of the protagonist’s inner issue, which is what motivates his actions.

Gilbert says, “every action has a cause and a consequence,”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 162
This means you can gauge whether a particular scene is part of the great chain of cause and effect by asking yourself these questions:    • Does this scene impart a crucial piece of information, without which some future scene won’t make sense?    • Does it have a clear cause the reader can see (even if the “real reason” it happened will be revealed later)?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 162
• Does it provide insight into why the characters acted as they did?    • Does it raise the reader’s expectation of specific, imminent action?

And that, my friends, is why, when it comes to digressions, heartless as it may seem, you have to kill them before they kill your story.

Mark Twain meant when he said, “A successful book is not made of what is in it, but what is left out.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 164
A digression is any piece of information that we don’t need and therefore don’t know what to do with.

the reader needs to know, at that moment

Does your story follow a cause-and-effect trajectory beginning on page one, so that each scene is triggered by the one that preceded
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 165
setting up a line of dominoes—you tap that first one, and they all fall in perfect order as each scene puts the “decision” made in the prior scene to the test.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 165
Does everything in your story’s cause-and-effect trajectory revolve around the protagonist’s quest (the story question)? If it doesn’t, get rid of it. It’s that easy.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 165
We don’t care about a hurricane, a stock market crash, or aliens taking over planet Earth unless it somehow directly affects your protagonist’s quest.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 165
When your protagonist makes a decision, is it always clear how she arrived at it, especially when she’s changing her mind about something? Don’t forget, just because you know what your protagonist is thinking doesn’t mean your readers will. Does each scene follow the action, reaction, decision pattern? It’s like the one, two, three of a waltz. Get that rhythm stuck in your head—action, reaction, decision—and then use it to build momentum.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 165
Can you answer the “And so?” to everything in the story? Ask this question relentlessly, like a four-year-old, and the minute you can’t answer, know that you’re likely in the company of a darling, a digression, or something else likely to cause your story to go into free fall.

The catch is, your protagonist really truly does have to suffer—otherwise not only will she have nothing to teach us, but we won’t have much reason to care about what happens to her, either.

Remember: a story revolves around events that force the protagonist to come to grips with a difficult inner issue—which, ironically, is something literary novels are far more geared to convey.

What’s more, physical pain is something one can keep to oneself. No one else has to know. But to embarrass someone? That’s public. Unlike physical pain, embarrassment says something about you—it means that you not only made a mistake, but that you were found out.

Do encourage your characters to lie. While in real life, we don’t want people to lie to us, in a story, characters who lie are the ones who catch our interest.

“The brain is a born cartographer,” says neuroscientist Antonio Damasio.3 From the moment we leave the womb, it begins charting the patterns around us, always with the same agenda: What’s safe, and what had I better keep my eye on?4

Chip and Dan Heath note, “The most basic way to get someone’s attention is this: Break a pattern.”5 Can you see the fine print? In order to break a pattern, we need to know what the pattern is.

Memory mines the information your brain has acquired in the past for anything that might help it solve the problem you’re facing in the present.

ON THE FINAL day of my sophomore year of high school, I was hit in the face with a baseball bat. As my classmate took a full swing, the bat slipped out of his hands and came flying toward me before striking me directly between the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of impact.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 134
I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again.

A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated small but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me when I started.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 150
changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often

depends on the quality of our habits.1 With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.

I began by publishing a new article every Monday and Thursday. Within a few months, this simple writing habit led to my first one thousand email subscribers, and by the end of 2013 that number had grown to more than thirty thousand people.

Behavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the right reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way. But while Skinner’s model did an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal states—our moods and emotions—matter, too. In recent decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. This research will also be covered in these pages.

WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
                

Pink highlight | Location: 247
It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 248
Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success
                

Pink highlight | Location: 248
requires massive action.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 249
Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.
                

Orange highlight | Location: 250
Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.12 Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.13
                

Orange highlight | Location: 260
The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.
                

Orange highlight | Location: 277
Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination.

The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.

FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 365
began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.

Yellow highlight | Location: 381
progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 383
Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 395
Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 397
When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 400
The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 404
Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 407
A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 414
The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 420
You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 442
Few things can have a more powerful impact on your life than improving your daily habits.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 448
Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 459
The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 461
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 464
Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 470
Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says,
                

Blue highlight | Location: 470
“No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs. The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 474
Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 483
Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 486
hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 497
The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 499
The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.

Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.

themselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 528
When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 537
Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 542
Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.fn2 More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 546
The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”
                

Blue highlight | Location: 557
Each experience in life modifies your self-image, but it’s unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 561
In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 561
This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit.6 We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 566
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 568
Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements. Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 576
Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 577
When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 583
It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 591
For example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’s probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent and reliable (identity-based).
                

Blue highlight | Location: 598
Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity.

Blue highlight | Location: 608
“Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. And that’s why we are starting here.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 610
You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can
                

Blue highlight | Location: 611
choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real reason habits matter.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 619
■ There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 621
The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 622
Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 625
The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 649
A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 650
The process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come across a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike’s cat, you’re just trying things out to see what works.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 663
As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”
                

Blue highlight | Location: 670
Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.7
                

Blue highlight | Location: 677
Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 682
Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In
                

Blue highlight | Location: 697
First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 703
Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 709
For someone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are just background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 716
habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.

Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones.11 Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.

All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face.

Whenever you experience something repeatedly—like a paramedic seeing the face of a heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile on a radar screen—your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.

Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why.

We mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur: the home, the office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to certain habits and routines.

overweight, a smoker, or an addict, you’ve been told your entire life that it is because you lack self-control—maybe even that you’re a bad person. The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply embedded in our culture.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,274
Recent research, however, shows something different. When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling.

Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,372
like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,373
Humans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality. Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. After spending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah. When you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an excellent strategy for survival.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 1,377
Today, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is abundant, but your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing a high value on salt, sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our health, but the craving persists because the brain’s reward centers have not changed for approximately fifty thousand years. The modern food industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond their evolutionary purpose.

The modern food industry, and the overeating habits it has spawned, is just one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: Make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.

Look around. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in.

Advertisements are created with a combination of ideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits—even the model doesn’t look like the person in the final image. These are the supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating habits, and many others.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,406
Compared to nature, these pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,408
While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works. We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share—the dopamine spike.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,412
Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine.fn1
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,421
Even though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped.11
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,424
In one study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they poked their nose in a box. Within minutes, the mice developed a craving so

Blue highlight | Location: 1,428
Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.14 Every behavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,431
For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary movement.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,433
dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,436
Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,438
It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action.
                

Orange highlight | Location: 1,439
Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward.18 This is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer to this as the difference between “wanting” and “liking.”
                

Orange highlight | Location: 1,459
Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.
                

Orange highlight | Location: 1,459
The wanting centers in the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal cortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much smaller. They are often referred to as “hedonic hot spots” and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance, researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated during wanting.19 Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is activated during liking.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,464
The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,465
of the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response. These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change. We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling comes into play.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,493
Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.”23 In other words, even if you don’t really want to process overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along the way.

One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day. If you are surrounded by fit people, you’re more likely to consider working out to be a common habit. If you’re surrounded by jazz lovers, you’re more likely to believe it’s reasonable to play jazz every day.

But there can be a downside. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. For example, one study found that when a chimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effective strategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps.

The human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along with others. This is our natural mode.

We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status. We want to be the one in the gym who can do muscle-ups or the musician who can play the hardest chord progressions or the parent with the most accomplished children because these things separate us from the crowd. Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.

We are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status. We trim our hedges and mow our lawn because we don’t want to be the slob of the neighborhood. When our mother comes to visit, we clean up the house because we don’t want to be judged.

Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,721
Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it. Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,723
in our discussion of the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing information and noticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,734
Two people can look at the same cigarette, and one feels the urge to smoke while the other is repulsed by the smell. The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,736
These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,741
A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap between what your body is currently sensing and what it wants to be sensing. This gap between your current state and your desired state provides a reason to act.

Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future.

Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make

In time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,756
You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family. Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.4 You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,763
The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.

Pregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big presentation or competing in an important event. They experience quicker breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal.

with a particular habit or situation. If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation.

Ed Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh, benefited from a similar strategy without knowing it.8 “Odd realization,” he wrote. “My focus and concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on] while writing. I don’t even have to play any music.” Without realizing it, he was conditioning himself. In the beginning, he put his headphones on, played some music he enjoyed, and did focused work. After doing it five, ten, twenty times, putting his headphones on became a cue that he automatically associated with increased focus. The craving followed naturally.

Once established, you can break it out anytime you need to change your emotional state. Stressed at work? Take three deep breaths and smile. Sad about life? Three deep breaths and smile.

ON THE FIRST day of class, Jerry Uelsmann, a professor at the University of Florida, divided his film photography students into two groups. Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in the “quantity” group. They would be graded solely on the amount of work they produced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of photos submitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.

Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the “quality” group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their work.

At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality group sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo.

I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,858
Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.

It was a powerful example of the fourth and final Law of Behavior Change: make it satisfying.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 2,375
We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.

Stories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. You learn what to do in the future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.

The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop. But there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.

The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment. The earliest remains of modern humans,
                

Blue highlight | Location: 2,408
known as Homo sapiens sapiens, are approximately two hundred thousand years old.12 These were the first humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours. In particular, the neocortex—the newest part of the brain and the region responsible for higher functions like language—was roughly the same size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are walking around with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.13

Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these outcomes are often misaligned.

However, when the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually wins.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,446
Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,450
People who are better at delaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior social skills.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,456
Thankfully, it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification—but you need to work with the grain of human nature, not
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,457
against it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 2,459
The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if it’s in a small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off and that the work was worth the effort.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 2,466
What we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing immediate rewards—is the ending of a behavior. The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other
                

Pink highlight | Location: 2,468
The best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 2,469
Habit stacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.

The immediate reward of seeing yourself save money toward the leather

jacket feels a lot better than being deprived. You are making it satisfying to do nothing.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 2,487
Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 2,492
In summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits of reinforcement—like soap that smells great or toothpaste that has a refreshing mint flavor or seeing $50 hit your savings account—can offer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is enjoyable.

Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on the process rather than the result. You’re not fixated on getting six-pack abs, you’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts.

The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,840
Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts). Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident,

As a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality trait all people possess to various degrees. People who are high in neuroticism tend to be anxious and worry more than others. This trait has been

linked to hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for noticing threats.14 In other words, people who are more sensitive to negative cues in their environment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.

Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you. People who are talented in a particular area tend to be more competent at that task and are then praised for doing a good job. They stay energized because they are making progress where others have failed, and because they get rewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them happier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality work. It’s a virtuous cycle.

Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away.19 This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and performers experience when they are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree.

Where do I get greater returns than the average person? We are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favor.

What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.

When you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren’t perfect. This is an idea we covered in detail while discussing the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.

A flow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and fully immersed in an activity. Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling. They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current ability.5 In real life it’s typically not feasible to quantify the difficulty of an action in this way, but the core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just manageable difficulty—something on the perimeter of your ability—seems crucial for maintaining motivation.

Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement.

He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.”

His answer surprised me because it’s a different way of thinking about work ethic. People talk about getting “amped up” to work on their goals. Whether it’s business or sports or art, you hear people say things like, “It all comes down to passion.” Or, “You have to really want it.” As a result, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or motivation because we think that successful people have some bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,020
really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.

The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us.

As Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”

In psychology, this is known as a variable reward.7 fn2 Slot machines are the most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,036
spike of dopamine, enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 3,037
Variable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce boredom.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 3,043
Of course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and you wouldn’t want them to. If Google only delivered a useful search result some of the time, I would switch to a competitor pretty quickly. If Uber only picked up half of my trips, I doubt I’d be using that service much longer.

I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a business, there will be days when you don’t feel like showing up. When you’re at the gym, there will be sets that you don’t feel like finishing. When it’s time to write, there will be days that you don’t feel like typing. But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.

There have been a lot of articles I haven’t felt like writing, but I’ve never regretted publishing on schedule.

I will hazard a prediction. When you are 80 years old and in a quiet moment of reflection, narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life’s story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are our choices. —Jeff Bezos, 2010 Princeton Commencement

Millennials, that vital under-forty market, are not only banishing advertising from their lives but sneering at the institution itself, denouncing its bragging and promising as deceitful, manipulative, the next thing to micro-aggression.

Many chief marketing officers swear they will never again trust advertising to deliver customers. Some CMOs condemn ad agencies for wasting time and money trying to be Super Bowl–creative instead of market-effective. Others blame the noise from free online ads that drowns out their paid ads. Still others complain that falling return on investment (ROI) and rising costs make advertising just too damn expensive. Of course, if advertising suddenly redelivered the mass consumers of decades past, all would be forgiven.

results. The difference between data and story is this: Data lists what happened; story expresses how and why it happened. Data compiles facts by quantity and frequency; story reveals the causalities behind and beneath those facts. Story eliminates irrelevancies, concentrates on dynamic change, and then reshapes factual subject matter into a structure that links events into chains of cause and effect, played out over time.

Classical marketing theory asserts this premise: Human beings are rational decision makers who, when faced with an important choice, gather relevant facts, weigh alternatives, then choose the best option. Therefore, to persuade consumers, present your claims in a factual, logical, scientific manner.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 293
Rhetoric imitates science by presenting evidence and drawing a conclusion, but the difference is that science weighs all evidence, both for and against a theorem; rhetoric slants its argument by laying out only the evidence that supports its claim,
                

Blue highlight | Location: 295
science seeks the truth; rhetoric seeks the win. Marketing, in essence, is a public forum for rhetorical debate, a platform to persuade the

consumer that one product’s features outperform another’s.

As the savvy prospective buyer scans the chart, he knows two things: (1) The company self-selected only those categories in which its brand scores best. (2) Categories in which the product scored worse than the competition were left off the list.

Now more than ever, marketing via rhetorical argument provokes skepticism in the mind of the customer and a negative attitude toward your product or service.

The fundamental problems never change: how to capture attention, hold it, and reward it; in short, how to
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 329
turn people on, not off. 2. Emotional Communication
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 330
At the heart of an effective creative philosophy is the belief that nothing is so powerful as an insight into human nature, what compulsions drive a man, what instincts dominate his action, even though his language so often camouflages what really motivates him. —Bill Bernbach
                

Blue highlight | Location: 337
According to one biography, Bernbach spoke to clients “. . . not of advertising, but the art of persuasion. To persuade the consumer, the creators of ads needed to touch people’s basic, unchanging instincts—their ‘obsessive drive to survive, to be admired, to succeed, to love, to take care of their own.’”4
                

Blue highlight | Location: 340
The first step to mastering emotional manipulation is to realize that there are only two primary emotions, pleasure and pain.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 348
As Paul Bloom, professor of psychology and behavioral science at Yale, explains in his book How Pleasure Works, “What matters most is not the world as it appears to our senses. Rather, the enjoyment (or suffering) we get from something derives from what we think that thing is.”7
                

Blue highlight | Location: 351
Bloom claims that we are essentialists. Our response is conditioned by our beliefs of what things really are, what their essential nature is.8
                

Blue highlight | Location: 357
But the Caltech study used an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) device to observe the volunteers’ brain activity. The imaging revealed that when the participants drank what they believed to be a more expensive wine, the region of the brain linked to pleasure lit up.9 It wasn’t snobbery. They actually enjoyed greater
                

Blue highlight | Location: 360
pleasure from the wines they believed were more expensive.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 365
The finding: Participants who believed they were shocked intentionally felt the shocks more painfully, and the pain lingered throughout the study. Those who believed that the shocks were unintentional experienced less pain and a quicker recovery.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 367
For both pleasure and pain, the meaning of the perception, not the sensory experience alone, determines how much pleasure or pain people experience. Because pleasure and pain are great motivators, creating these experiences within an ad promised to be marketing’s most powerful tool.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 369
Unfortunately, however, this insight devolved into the techniques of seduction and coercion. Seduction entices someone to do something with the promise of pleasure; coercion persuades
                

Blue highlight | Location: 370
them to act with the threat of pain.

screen. That’s why nearly two-thirds of millennials
                

Blue highlight | Location: 380
What’s left? If emotional manipulation angers people, and if rhetorical persuasion strikes them as BS, how can you connect with your customers? How can you solve your marketing crisis?
                

Blue highlight | Location: 383
We advocate a solution that’s tens of thousands of years old, the mode of communication that best fits the mind, that best connects one mind with another, that wraps the clarity of a rational message inside an emotional package and delivers it with sticking power: story.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 386
Emotional because we empathize with its characters; meaningful because the actions of our protagonist deliver insights into human nature.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 389
Many assume that because they’ve seen and heard a lifetime
                

Blue highlight | Location: 389
of stories, they could easily create one. But that’s like thinking you can compose music because you’ve been to concerts.

Yellow highlight | Location: 396
In short, story is the ultimate I.T. I in that storytelling demands information—a wide and deep knowledge of human nature and its relationship with the social and physical realms. T in that a well-told story demands skillful execution of its inner technology, its mechanisms of action/reaction, changing value charges, roles, conflicts, turning points, emotional dynamics, and much more. A craft underpins the art. Story structure, as we’ll see in the next chapter, is intrinsic to the human mind. Why then do we need to learn its craft? Isn’t storytelling natural? By the same token, children can sketch stick figures. Isn’t drawing also natural? Yes, both are, but to achieve excellence, authors and painters move beyond instinct to experiment and master their craft anew.

The mind, of course, does not convert every trivial change to story. Instead evolution has taught us to focus on meaningful, dynamic change. Storified thought interprets every event in terms of its core value. In story creation, however, the word value does not refer to mono-concepts such as success, truth, loyalty, love, or freedom. Those words name only half a value. Dynamic events affect our lives not as singularities but as binaries of positive/negative value charge. They pivot our lives around experiences of success/failure, truth/lie, loyalty/betrayal, love/hate, right/wrong, rich/poor,…

Pink highlight | Location: 498
Self-Awareness: The power to distinguish the mind’s subjective, core self from its objective, public self and observe the outer self as if it were a separate personality.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 507
For the storyteller, other-awareness guides the creation of the characters that make the choices and take the actions that carry out the story. 3. Memory: The power to store and recall experience.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 509
The past makes the future in this way: Memory builds an understanding of people and the world by recording patterns of experience, stacking them one on top of another by what they have in common, and then telling itself, “This is how the world works.”
                

Pink highlight | Location: 511
The mind then uses these patterns from the past in an effort to control the future by taking actions designed to make history repeat itself.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 515
4. Intelligence: The power to extract knowledge from both formal learning and everyday experience, and then apply deductive, inductive, and causal logics to reason to factual, truthful conclusions.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 518
Imagination: The power to reshape reality into undreamed-of possibilities.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 522
Insight: The power to see through appearances and perceive inner causalities.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 522
An insightful mind reads surface signs and then senses the hidden forces that move within and cause things to happen.
                

Orange highlight | Location: 523
Data, for example, only measures the outer results of what has changed; insight discovers how and why what has changed has changed.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 524
The storyteller, as we will see, uses this keen perspective to show us a world we think we understand, but then cracks open reality to first surprise us, then deliver a rush of insight into the hows and whys of that world and its characters. A lifetime of story-driven insights civilizes human beings, builds institutions, and makes culture viable.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 527
Correlation: The power to create. The correlating mind takes two things it already knows, and then seeks a hidden connection, a third thing that joins the two in a way no one else has ever seen before.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 533
Self-Expression: The power to perform.

So, in the marketing context, the takeaway is this: Storified communication is the most powerful form of messaging because story fits the mind; story fits the mind because the mind converts actuality into story in the first place. It’s a tautology. As Hamlet says, “There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.”

Story, like art and music, is a word you think you understand until you try to define it.

Let’s clarify what story is by first looking at what it is not and eliminating any weak synonyms or false equivalents.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 562
STORY IS NOT A PROCESS
                

Pink highlight | Location: 565
But unlike a story, a process has neither a desire nor a conflict nor a core character. As a result, no one’s life is touched or changed. A process accumulates; a story progresses.

Blue highlight | Location: 577
time and space to fulfill her desire.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 578
STORY IS NOT A NARRATIVE
                

Blue highlight | Location: 578
Many marketing campaigns have flopped because an ad agency didn’t know the difference between narrative and story.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 581
All stories are narratives, but not all narratives are stories.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 581
Narratives tend to be flat, bland, repetitive, and boring recitations of events.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 582
They slide through the mind like juice through a goose, and as a result, they have little or no influence on customers.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 583
Stories, on the other hand, are value-charged and progressive. The mind embraces a well-told story; the imagination is its natural home. Once through our mental door, story fits, sticks, and excites consumer choice. The next time you’re bored to the bone by somebody’s “story,” in all likelihood you’re not being told a story. If you were, you’d be listening and engrossed. Instead the guy is torturing you with a narrative, probably a repetitious recitation of “. . . and then I did this and then I did that and then I did the other thing and then and then and then…”

What is a story, precisely? The essential core event in all stories ever told in the history of humanity can be expressed in just three words: Conflict changes life. Therefore, the prime definition becomes: a dynamic escalation of conflict-driven events that cause meaningful change in a character’s life.

Yellow highlight | Location: 609
STAGE TWO: SUBJECT MATTER PRIME PRINCIPLE: BALANCE A story takes place at a specific time in a specific physical and social world. As the telling begins, the PROTAGONIST’s life is anchored in a core value that rests in a state of balance.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 615
The core value in Beane’s career—success/failure—rests in balance.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 616
STAGE THREE: THE INCITING INCIDENT PRIME PRINCIPLE: IMBALANCE The inciting incident is an unforeseen event that starts the story by upsetting the balance of the core character’s life. The neutral charge of its core value turns sharply positive or negative. Either way, this radical change puts the character under pressure.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 620
This inciting incident turns the balance of Beane’s life sharply to the positive.

STAGE FOUR: THE OBJECT OF DESIRE PRIME PRINCIPLE: AN UNFULFILLED NEED
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 626
When the CORE CHARACTER senses that the inciting incident has thrown his life out of balance and into jeopardy, he naturally wants to set life back on an even keel.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 633
STAGE SIX: THE FIRST REACTION PRIME PRINCIPLE: THE VIOLATION OF EXPECTATION
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 637
The Oakland A’s lose twenty-six of their first forty-six games. Art Howe attacks sabermetrics as a failure, and against Beane’s wishes, he fields the lineup he wants.

STAGE SEVEN: THE CRISIS CHOICE PRIME PRINCIPLE: INSIGHT

a second action that’s more difficult, more risky than the first, yet one he hopes will cause a positive reaction that will finally get him what he wants.

Yellow highlight | Location: 644
In a compact story, the protagonist’s second action causes a climactic reaction that matches his expectations and grants him his object of desire. This climax restores the core character’s life to balance and ends the story.

Eight Stages of Story Design Stage One: Target Audience = A Meaningful Emotional Effect Stage Two: Subject Matter = Balance Stage Three: Inciting Incident = Imbalance Stage Four: Object of Desire = Need Stage Five: First Action = Tactical Choice Stage Six: First Reaction = Violation of Expectation Stage Seven: Crisis Choice = Insight Stage Eight: Climactic Reaction = Closure

Most marketing uses brief, compact stories. In the practical world of business, the brevity of advertising time, along with the high costs of creatives and production, confines marketing stories to one or two turning points. MEANING
                

Blue highlight | Location: 682
First, at the core of all stories pulses at least one binary value—such as life/death, freedom/tyranny, success/failure, truth/lie, love/hate, and the like.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 686
Second, the dynamic of cause and effect within the story’s events expresses the hows and whys,

Writers of fiction for page, stage, and screen have little difficulty imagining their story’s buying public.

At the end of the day, the professional writer judges his quality of work not by its effect on him, but by the degree to which the effect he hoped for affects his readers or audience.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 708
Subject matter for a story contains three major components: a physical and social setting, a protagonist, and a core value. Life offers the storyteller an infinite variety of each.
                

Orange highlight | Location: 710
In fact, more often than not, the spark of originality that ignites an exceptional story flashes through a creative’s imagination not while she daydreams, but as she sweats out the grunt work of founding her story-world and planting its setups.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 712
World-building, therefore, is storytelling’s critical second step.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 713
The weakest choices of all favor the general over the specific.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 716
The mind works best when it moves from the specific to the universal—not the other way around. Consider, for example, the phrase a piece of furniture.
                
Note:Important

particular. But if I say, “A wingback Duchess chair upholstered in blood-red leather,” a clear image glows in your mind. Instinctively, your imagination moves forward from this particular to the general, slotting the chair into the mental category “furniture.” This applies to all aspects of a story’s world, physical and social.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 720
Therefore, the principle: The more specific the setting, the more universal the story’s appeal.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 731
(1) Physical—the horizontal landscape and every object on it. (2) Social—the vertical hierarchy of a society’s pyramid of power and the possibility for movement up or down.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 736
Every physical setting contains a social setting as well, a cast of characters defined by demographic factors such as age, gender, income, employment, and ethnicity. What’s more, this cast lives in a culture defined first and foremost by its values—its ideality versus its reality, what its citizens believe they should do versus what in fact they do.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 739
THE CORE VALUE
                

Blue highlight | Location: 743
But for the story-maker, the values he invests in his telling come not as singularities but binaries of positive/negative charge: truth/lie, love/hate, generosity/selfishness, hard work/laziness, loyalty/betrayal, life/death, courage/cowardice, hope/despair, meaningfulness/meaninglessness, maturity/immaturity, justice/injustice, and on the list goes, naming all those qualities of
                

Blue highlight | Location: 745
human experience that can shift charge dynamically from positive to negative and back again.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 747
but it anchors its content in one irreplaceable binary—the story’s core value. This value determines a story’s fundamental meaning and emotion.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 754
The core value that pulses at the heart of a story determines its specific meaning and unique emotional impact.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 761
A core character must be empathetic; she or he may or may not be sympathetic.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 763
Empathetic means “like me”—an innate trait shared by both the core character and the target audience.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 764
Sympathy is optional, empathy essential, for this reason: Audience involvement hinges on an act of personal identification.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 765
Rather, the psychological bond of empathy only develops when an audience subconsciously identifies with a positive human quality emanating from within the character. This quality becomes the story’s center of good.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 768
The moment a story appears in front of audience members or readers, they instantly and instinctively inspect its value-charged landscape, seeking an emotional door into the story, a place to stick their empathy. They sort the positives from the negatives, the goods from the bads, the rights from the wrongs, the things of value from the things of no value. Everyone searches for a center of good because, in his heart of hearts, everyone instinctively sees himself as good.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 773
Therefore, all people, regardless of their humanity or lack of it, seek a positive glow somewhere in a story’s world, a mooring for their empathy.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 774
Ideally, the storyteller places this center of good within the protagonist so that a positive human quality emanates from within the core character and captures the audience’s personal involvement. This empathy magnet also anchors the mirror story, which we will explain in
                

Blue highlight | Location: 779
Before a story begins, its physical setting, social setting, core value, and core character rest in a state of balance.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 791
First, it captures
                

Blue highlight | Location: 792
As we pointed out earlier, the mind keys on change, and the inciting incident’s sudden pivot of the protagonist’s life sharply focuses the audience’s interest.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 794
When you think back, how many perfectly lousy stories have you sat through for no other reason than to get the answer to the nagging question: “How does this piece of dreck turn out?”
                

Pink highlight | Location: 795
Third, when curiosity over the MDQ merges with empathy for the protagonist, a story generates the compelling magnetism known as suspense. Suspense doubles involvement. This blend of subjective identification with objective wonder magnifies a story’s power tenfold.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 804
the inciting incident arouses the natural human desire to regain control and restore balance.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 806
and so conceives of an object of desire,
                

Pink highlight | Location: 806
This could be something physical like a hike in pay, a product innovation, or the right person
                

Pink highlight | Location: 809
Nonetheless, all stories dramatize the essential human struggle to move life from chaos to order, from imbalance to equilibrium.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 810
We measure the worth of the object of desire in terms of risk: the greater the risk, the greater the object’s worth. What would you risk your time for? What would you risk your life for? What would you risk your soul for? The most compelling objects of desire come with the highest price tags, and the greater the object’s worth, the greater the involvement. Contrariwise, watching a character pursue something of no real value is the definition of boredom.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 815
storytelling becomes the art of merging and organizing many streams of want into a flow of events that aims at a single object of desire.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 823
These desires not only cement the status quo of a character’s life but also temper his behavior. Background desires form the web of restraints that follow every character into every scene. These fixed desires for stability limit the character’s actions, restraining what he may or may not say or do to get what he wants.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 826
Desire answers what questions: What does the character consciously want? What does he subconsciously long for? Motivation answers why questions. Why does a character want what he wants? Why does he want his particular object of desire?
                

Pink highlight | Location: 828
The roots of human motivation reach deep into childhood and, for that reason, are often irrational.

Biographers of historical figures—Charles Darwin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Picasso—devote chapter upon chapter detailing the upbringing of each, trying to

STAGE FIVE: THE FIRST ACTION PRIME PRINCIPLE: TACTICAL CHOICE
                

Blue highlight | Location: 835
Desire demands deeds.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 836
This positive/negative dynamic propels his story to climax.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 838
Every human being acts from one moment to the next on his personal sense of probability, on what he feels will probably happen when he does what he intends to do next.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 843
From his quiver of personal tactics, he draws strategic behaviors, all in an effort to move toward his desire of the moment and long-term hopes.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 844
And because, like everyone else, he is one of a kind, his sense of what will probably happen when he takes an action will also be one of a kind; therefore, his choice of tactic (exact words, gestures, facial expressions, and so on) will, in turn, be one of a kind.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 847
It’s this infinitude of idiosyncratic tactics that inspires storytellers to imagine unique characters, the sort found in the best-told stories, with behaviors like no one else’s, behaviors that fascinate.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 849
Evolution programmed the genes of every living thing to conserve life down to the last calorie of energy, take no uncalled-for risks, and yet pursue all necessary desires. Therefore, human nature, as a part of Mother Nature, always takes the conservative, minimal, and yet sufficient action in an effort to get what it wants.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 853
A character will never do less than she has to, nor will she ever do more than she needs to; instead, she will take the minimal, conservative, yet sufficient action that she believes will move her closer to a balanced life.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 856
Ninety-nine percent of our actions cause the responses we more or less expect.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 859
To create a meaningful emotional experience for his audience, the storyteller evicts all empty moments, all trivialities and banalities, and embraces those events, and only those events, that bring value-charged change.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 860
To create value-charged change, the storyteller pits the core character’s sense of probability against reality’s forces of necessity.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 867
When a character’s world suddenly reacts differently and/or more powerfully than he imagined, this violation of expectation delivers a jolt of surprise, followed by a rush of insight. The clash between what he thinks will happen and the result he actually gets jolts him and splits open his reality.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 869
The character stares, as it were, into the gap between his subjective anticipation and its objective result. Then with a rush of insight, he suddenly glimpses how his world actually works; how its unforeseen forces of antagonism now block his path.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 873
When an unanticipated, even contradictory, obstacle violates a protagonist’s expectations, it moves him farther from his object of desire than he was before he acted.

Inner Obstacles: Contradictory forces within a character’s body, emotions, and mind with its warring conscious and subconscious desires.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 891
To turn a scene means to change its value charge; the phrase turning point names the precise moment when an unforeseen force of antagonism violates expectations and pivots the value at stake from positive to negative or negative to positive.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 893
Turning points trigger change in only one of two ways—either by a direct action followed by the reaction it sparks, or by a revelation of a secret or previously unknown fact and the response it unleashes.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 898
The Rational Effects of TURNING POINTS A violation of expectation is, in essence, an effect with an unknown cause. As a result, turning points pop questions into the mind such as “Why have things taken this unforeseen turn? Why didn’t the character see this coming? Why didn’t I? What caused this startling twist?”
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 901
A turning point punches a hole in reality. Curiosity
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 901
compels the audience members to fill the hole with knowledge, so their thoughts rush back through previous scenes and images, looking for an unseen cause, trying to solve the mystery of “Why?” The answer has been planted beneath the story’s setups. The moment the audience glimpses this hidden truth, it erupts with an “Oh, yeah, now I get it!” insight that both delights and enlightens.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 911
As Aristotle observed, the deepest audience pleasure is learning without being taught. When a tale dramatizes its meaning skillfully, the audience feels no mental strain and yet comes away with a fuller understanding of the workings of the world and the human heart.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 916
the like. The mind’s ranking process keys on the potential for change. So long as life’s conditions run in neutral, the mind pays no attention and goes about its many tasks. But when things change, awareness snaps to alert as our animal instincts warn us that change threatens survival.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 922
Emotion, therefore, is the side effect of change. When the mind senses change from negative to positive, it releases pleasure-giving chemicals; if the mind registers a movement from positive to negative, it unleashes a painful flow.

In 2013, Hugo Veiga created a video titled Dove Real Beauty Sketches.2 The story follows a group of women who volunteer for an odd experiment: They agree to have their portrait done by a sketch artist who cannot see them. Instead they will simply tell him what they look like. This act of courage immediately draws empathy from the audience.

The story climaxes on the doubly positive charge of self-appreciation. During this decisive transition, the audience shares in the women’s triumph over self-criticism and feels, with them, a positive emotion.

All well-told stories express how and why life changes, and, as we noted above,
                

Orange highlight | Location: 948
the side effect of change is emotion.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 949
These feelings, however, only come to life during a transition. As a story shifts from positive to negative, the audience feels a dark emotion; as it transitions from negative to positive, a light emotion fills them. Once change completes itself, however, emotion quickly dissipates, ready to move in a new direction. To grip and hold emotional involvement, a story’s values must transition dynamically from change to change to change.

Every living thing, flora and fauna, instinctively heeds the two laws governing the conservation of energy and life: (1) Never do anything you don’t have to do if you can get what you want the easier way. (2) Never take any risk you don’t have to take if you can get what you want the safer way.

Dilemmas also come in two kinds, and both are hard because they pose a choice between either two positives or two negatives, known respectively as irreconcilable goods and the lesser of two evils.

Unlike full-length fictions, purpose-told stories abbreviate events. The typical business story is a mini-tale told in a thirty-second commercial or a three-minute YouTube video. GE’s “Owen” ads and the Dove Real Beauty Sketches are two perfect examples of each.

The marketing story, no. Purpose-told works crack open the gap between expectation and result usually only once, perhaps twice, maybe three times at the most.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,028
The purpose-told’s audience members take their storified experience into the real world and relive it each and every time they purchase the subject product or service. In other words, the purpose of the purpose-told story is to transform the aesthetic pleasure of a story’s climax into a viable action in the marketplace—to turn audiences into consumers.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,032
we gain an insight into life we never knew before, all enveloped in emotions we never felt quite that way before. This fusion of idea and emotion adds a measure of enrichment, great or small, to our inner life. We exit a beautifully told story a fuller human being than when we entered.

The fiction-told story fulfills itself in one telling, whereas the purpose-told story retells its tale in the mind of the consumer each and every time she buys its product or hires its service.

Concentrated experiences entertain because they carry us through time unaware of the passage of time.

The audience of the purpose-told story, on the other hand, ignores the artist and feels brand loyalty instead. Brand loyalty, and the lifetime of purchases that comes with it, is created by the mirror experience at the heart of the purpose-told story. THE MIRROR EXPERIENCE Well-told stories create two simultaneous experiences that mirror each other: one mental, the other emotional. The mental mirror experience begins and ends with curiosity. A story’s inciting incident teases the audience’s mind with unanswered questions such as “What’s going to happen next? What’ll happen after that? How will this story turn out? Will the protagonist win his object of desire?” The rational mirror experience in story mirrors the same set
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,059
First, the identification. The moment the target consumer recognizes a shared humanity between herself and the protagonist, her instincts follow the logic of kinship: “That character is a human being like me. Therefore, I want that character to get what he wants, because if I were that character in that situation, I would want the same thing for myself.” In other words, she bonds.2
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,065
She instinctively experiences the events as if they were happening to her.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,067
Third, the reenactment. The consumer’s mirror experience motivates her to act. Wishing to relive the positive charge of the purpose-told story, she purchases the product or hires the service embedded in the telling. Her post-story reenactment satisfies her need and the marketer’s purpose simultaneously. In short, she becomes a customer.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,074
The mind memorizes the patterns of cause and effect that underlie real-life past events so it can strategize its future actions. As events impact us over the years, we gather knowledge of how things work, how the various forces in our world interconnect. When new situations arise, the mind draws on these past patterns to imagine the possible tactics it might take and predict the probable reactions these actions might cause.

This process of linking previous encounters to future outcomes underlies not only factual but also fictional experience.

Consider, for example, the storified marketing campaign that saved a brand from virtual extinction, “Real Beauty” by Dove. As we demonstrated in the emotion-creation section of the previous chapter, this insight into the target audience’s inciting incident and resulting object of desire inspired Ogilvy & Mather to weave a purpose-told story around the core value of self-criticism versus self-appreciation.

fact, for many business stories, the only logical choice for protagonist is a product or a corporation. If so, the tale must be told from that point of view. To do so, however, the storyteller faces this challenging problem: How can I fuse an empathetic connection between consumer and protagonist when the latter is either an inanimate object or an impersonal institution?

Fantasy worlds and characters demand imagination, innovation, and creative execution. Rather than face that task, many campaigns abandon storytelling in favor of a spokesperson bragging and making promises the product’s performance may or may not be able to keep.

To turn a corporation into an empathetic protagonist, the marketer first must identify the company’s primal value, a value so essential to its nature that if it were lost, the company would disappear with it.

But no matter how you characterize your protagonist, his reaction to the inciting incident should draw the audience’s empathy and emotional concern, placing him at the story’s center of good.

How does this object of desire relate to the core value (for example, just/unjust or rich/poor) of the story? And by extension, how does the story’s core value relate to my company’s core value? Your answers need not match perfectly, but they cannot be divorced. Values and desires must reflect each other and thus unify the story with the company that produces it.

Developing a compelling story means developing a conflict that relates to your audience, mirroring the positive/negative duality of their lives. Think about it. Life fills our hours with problems to be solved, needs to be met, desires to be satisfied—not enough time to get the job done, too far to go to get what you need, a romance on the rocks, an illness that resists cure.

Why do so many product and service ads deliver little, if any, impact? Answer: because their tellings deliberately avoid any hint of conflict. And why is that? Answer: negaphobia.

Negaphobia is a by-product of marketing education. Ever since the invention of the business school, and marketing as a unique discipline within its curriculum, marketers have been trained, as the old song goes, to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative.

To preempt blame, marketing executives cover their butts by outlawing the least hint of anything negative in their ads. As an unfortunate result, negaphobia not only distorts their business judgment, but also sucks the impact out of their messaging.

This insight puts the consumer’s mirror story on a path to solution and the satisfaction of her need. She doesn’t know how it will be done, but it’s out there, so she can’t look away. This curiosity holds your prospect’s attention, even in a world of constant distraction. Marketing stories are generally brief. The protagonist pursues her object of desire through usually only one turning point.

At this point in most fiction-told stories, the protagonist stands in dilemma, forced to choose between either two irreconcilable positive possibilities or two equally repugnant negative choices. Never in a marketing story. Rather, the insight the protagonist gained in Stage Six now gives her a clear choice of what to do to get what she wants. She conceives her new tactic and takes it.

Once you determine your audience (Stage One of the storytelling process), you must choose subject matter that contains a physical and social setting, a core value, and a protagonist (Stage Two). Subject matter possibilities for brands fall into at least five grand genres: origin, history, mission, product, and customer stories. You need a least one story to define your brand, but some brands tell thousands.

Original, sustainable story-driven content creation is not easy. Marketers with this ambition must develop a strategy, license a content marketing platform (CMP), recruit creatives, and implement a process for managing, reviewing, and improving that content every day. A regular publishing cadence of well-told stories requires time, money, and resources.
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,940
For that reason, some marketers cut corners and try to license or curate instead. Licensing content means that
                

Blue highlight | Location: 1,941
they pay a fee to media companies for the rights to pre-written stories or pre-produced videos. Curation eliminates fees by simply citing media stories and sending audiences to the original source.

Although content licensing and curating are cheap and fast, both are inherently flawed. If you use either means, how can you differentiate yourself from your competitors?

Robert Frost’s beautiful and memorable poem, “The Road Not Taken”:   Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; . . . I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.

Twenty-five years of research in seventeen different organizations has taught us that individuals who are the most influential—who can get things done and at the same time build on relationships—are those who master their crucial conversations.

high performers know how to stand up to the boss without committing career suicide. We’ve all seen people hurt their careers by ineffectively discussing tough issues.

You may have done it yourself. Fed up with a lengthy and unhealthy pattern of behavior, you finally speak out—but a bit too abruptly. Oops. Or maybe an issue becomes so hot that as your peers twitch and fidget themselves into a quivering mass of potential stroke victims, you decide to say something. It’s not a pretty discussion—but somebody has to have the guts to keep the boss from doing something stupid. (Gulp.)

You don’t have to choose between candor and your career.

People who routinely hold crucial conversations and hold them well are able to express controversial and even risky opinions in a way that gets heard. Their bosses, peers, and direct reports listen without becoming defensive or angry.

We wondered, “Are there a handful of moments when someone’s actions disproportionately affect key performance indicators?” And if so, what are those moments and how should we act when they occur?

In a study of over 7,000 doctors and nurses, we’ve found caregivers face this crucial moment all the time.
                

Orange highlight | Page: 11
And that’s not the problem! The real problem is that those who observe deviations or infractions say nothing.
                

Orange highlight | Page: 11
Across the world we’ve found that the odds of a nurse speaking up in this crucial moment are less than one in twelve. The odds of doctors stepping up to similar crucial conversations aren’t much better.

that their people work in silos. They do great at tasks that are handled entirely within their team. Unfortunately, close to 80 percent of the projects that require cross-functional cooperation cost far more than expected, produce less than hoped for, and run significantly over budget. We wondered why.
                

Orange highlight | Page: 12
For example, could they speak up if they thought the scope and schedule were
                

Orange highlight | Page: 12
unrealistic? Or did they go silent when a cross-functional team member began sloughing off? Or even more tricky—what should they do when an executive failed to provide leadership for the effort?

In most organizations, employees fell silent when these crucial moments hit.

Those who can’t handle their crucial conversations suffer in thirteen different ways (backstabbing, gossip, undermining, passive aggression, etc.) as much as three times more often in virtual teams than in colocated teams (Research Study: Long-Distance Loathing). • Influence change in colleagues who are bullying, conniving, dishonest, or incompetent. When nearly 1,000 respondents were asked, 93 percent of them said that, in their organization, people like this are almost “untouchable”—staying in their position four years or longer without being held accountable

The key to real change lies not in implementing a new process, but in getting people to hold one another accountable to the process.

And that requires Crucial Conversations skills.

In the worst companies, poor performers are first ignored and then transferred. In good companies, bosses eventually deal with problems. In the best companies, everyone holds everyone else accountable—regardless of level or position. The path to high productivity passes not through a static system, but through face-to-face conversations.

For example, when our colleague, Howard Markman, examined couples in the throes of heated discussions, he learned that people fall into three categories—those who digress into threats and name-calling, those who revert to silent fuming, and those who speak openly, honestly, and effectively.

Those who routinely failed their crucial conversations had far weaker immune systems than those who found a way to resolve them well.

We could go on for pages about how the ability to hold crucial conversations has an impact on your personal health.

“You’re saying that the way you talk or don’t talk affects your body? It could kill you?”

So how about you? What are the specific conversations that gnaw at you the most? Which conversations (if you held them or improved them) would strengthen your immune system, help ward off disease, and increase your quality of life and well-being?
                

Blue highlight | Page: 18
When stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions start to run strong, casual conversations transform into crucial ones.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 18
Ironically, the more crucial the conversation, the less likely we are to handle it well.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 18
And now for the good news. As we learn how to step up to crucial conversations—and handle them well—with one set of high-leverage skills we can influence virtually every domain of our lives.

One of the opinion leaders we became particularly interested in meeting was named Kevin. He was the only one of eight vice presidents in his company to be identified as exceedingly influential. We wanted to know why. So we watched him at work. At first, Kevin didn’t do anything remarkable. In truth, he looked like every other VP. He answered his phone, talked to his direct reports, and continued about his pleasant, but routine, routine.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 20
team. No vague claim went unclarified, no unsupported reasoning unquestioned.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 21
Kevin continued to explain what he saw happening, and when he finished the first minutes of this delicate exchange, Chris was quiet for a moment. Then he nodded his head. “You’re absolutely right,” he finally concluded. “I have been trying to force my opinion on you. Let’s back up and try again.”
                

Blue highlight | Page: 21
“Did you see how he did that? If you want to know how he gets things done, figure out what he just did.”
                

Blue highlight | Page: 21
So we did. In fact, we spent the next twenty-five years discovering what Kevin and people like him do. What typically set them apart from the rest of the pack was their ability to avoid what we came to call the Fool’s Choice.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 22
The mistake most of us make in our crucial conversations is we believe that we have to choose between telling the truth and keeping a friend.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 22
Consider Kevin, the all-star. When he took a breath and opened his mouth, his overriding question was, “How can I be 100 percent honest with Chris, and at the same time be 100 percent respectful?”
                

Blue highlight | Page: 22
They not only refused to make the Fool’s Choice, but they then acted in ways that were far more skilled than their colleagues.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 23
When it comes to risky, controversial, and emotional conversations, skilled people find a way to get all relevant information (from themselves and others) out into the open.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 23
At the core of every successful conversation lies the free flow of relevant information. People openly and honestly express their opinions, share their feelings, and articulate their theories. They willingly and capably share their views, even when their ideas are controversial or unpopular. It’s the one thing that, and precisely what, Kevin and the other extremely effective communicators we studied were routinely able to achieve. Now, to put a label on this spectacular talent—it’s called dialogue.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 23
di·a·logue or di·a·log (dì´ ∂-lôg´´, -lòg) n The free flow of meaning between two or more people.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 24
Each of us enters conversations with our own opinions, feelings, theories, and experiences about the topic at hand. This unique combination of thoughts and feelings makes up our personal pool of meaning. This pool not only informs us, but also propels our every action.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 24
People who are skilled at dialogue do their best to make it safe for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool—even ideas that at first glance appear controversial, wrong, or at odds with their own beliefs. Now, obviously, they don’t agree with every idea; they simply do their best to ensure that all ideas find their way into the open.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 24
As the Pool of Shared Meaning grows, it helps people in two ways. First, as individuals are exposed to more accurate and relevant information, they make better choices.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 24
In a very real sense, the Pool of Shared Meaning is a measure of
                

Blue highlight | Page: 24
a group’s IQ. The larger the shared pool, the smarter the decisions. And even though many people may be involved in a choice, when people openly and freely share ideas, the increased time investment is more than offset by the quality of the decision.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 24
On the other hand, we’ve all seen what happens when the shared pool is dangerously shallow. When people purposefully withhold meaning from one another, individually smart people can do collectively stupid things.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 25
Of course, hospitals don’t have a monopoly on fear. In every instance where bosses are smart, highly paid, confident, and outspoken (i.e., most of the world), people tend to hold back their opinions rather than risk angering someone in a position of power. On the other hand, when people feel comfortable speaking up and meaning does flow freely, the shared pool can dramatically increase a group’s ability
                

Blue highlight | Page: 25
to make better decisions. Consider what happened to Kevin’s group. As everyone on the team began to explain his or her opinion, people formed a clearer and more complete picture of the circumstances.

On a beautiful sunset balcony in Houston, my dad and I spent three tense hours dealing with a lot of pain and built-up resentment. I kept in mind what I had been taught and, rather than compromising candor, tried my best to create the conditions where we could be both honest and respectful. It was incredibly difficult. Sometimes the honesty threatened to put us right back in the angry state that got us there. But I kept focusing on what I really wanted—a relationship with my family.

This is what most people have in mind when they think of crucial conversations. How do I express delicate feedback? How do I speak persuasively, not abrasively? And how about listening?

As you read on, you will learn the key skills of talking, listening, and acting

We were wondering what had happened to Greta? How, we puzzled, did she remain so composed while under fire? Specifically, how did she move so quickly from wanting to get even with or possibly even humiliate the questioner to sincerely soliciting feedback?
                

Orange highlight | Page: 41
What had helped her move from embarrassment and anger to gratitude?
                

Orange highlight | Page: 41
“At first I did feel attacked, and I wanted to strike back. To be honest, I wanted to put that guy in his place. He was accusing me in public, and he was wrong.”
                

Orange highlight | Page: 41
“And then it struck me,” she continued. “Despite the fact that I had 400 eyeballs pinned to me, a rather important question hit me like a ton of bricks: ‘What do I really want here?’”
                

Orange highlight | Page: 41
Asking this question had a powerful effect on Greta’s thinking. As she focused on this far more important question, she quickly realized that her goal was to encourage these 200 managers to embrace the cost-reduction efforts—and to thereby influence thousands of others to do the same.
                

Orange highlight | Page: 41
As Greta contemplated this goal, she realized that the biggest barrier she faced was the widespread belief that she was a hypocrite.
                

Orange highlight | Page: 42
Interestingly, by transforming her motives Greta simultaneously transformed the way she saw the man who asked the question. Whereas seconds earlier he looked like an enemy, when her motives changed, the fellow now looked like an ally. In fact, this man had just handed her the best chance she could get to influence the audience by letting her publicly address a primary source of resistance to the cost-cutting effort. And so Greta moved to dialogue.

Refocus your brain. Now, let’s move to a situation you might face. You’re speaking with someone who completely disagrees with you on a hot issue. How does all of this goal stuff apply? As you begin the discussion, start by examining your motives. Going in, ask yourself what you really want. Also, as the conversation unfolds and you find yourself starting to, say, defer to the boss or give your spouse the cold shoulder, pay attention to what’s happening to your objectives. Are you starting to change your goal to save face, avoid embarrassment, win, be right, or punish others? Here’s the…

In order to move back to motives that allow for dialogue, you must step away from the interaction and look at yourself—much like an outsider. Ask yourself: “What am I doing, and if I had to guess, what does it tell me about my underlying motive?” As you make an honest effort to discover your motive, you might conclude: “Let’s see. I’m pushing hard, making the argument stronger than I actually believe, and…

colleagues—under the influence of adrenaline we start to see our options as unnecessarily limited. We assume we have to choose between getting results and keeping a relationship. In our dumbed-down condition, we don’t even consider the option of achieving both.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 45
That’s why those who are skilled at crucial conversations present their brain with a more complex question. They routinely ask: “What do I want for myself, the other person, and the relationship?”
                

Blue highlight | Page: 45
When our brain isn’t functioning well, we resist complexity. We adore the ease of simply choosing between attacking
                

Blue highlight | Page: 45
or hiding—and the fact that we think it makes us look good. “I’m sorry, but I just had to destroy the guy’s self-image if I was going to keep my integrity. It wasn’t pretty, but it was the right thing to do.”

that. You’ll find there is a way to share your concerns, listen sincerely to those of others, and build the relationship—all at the same time. And the results can be life changing.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 46
First, clarify what you really want. You’ve got a head start if you’ve already Started with Heart. If you know what you want for yourself, for others, and for the relationship, then you’re in position to break out of the Fool’s Choice. “What I want is for my husband to be more reliable. I’m tired of being let down by him when he makes commitments that I depend on.” Second, clarify what you really don’t want. This is the key to framing the and question. Think of what you are afraid will happen to you if you back away from your current strategy of trying to win or stay safe. What bad thing will happen if you stop pushing so hard? Or if you don’t try to escape? What horrible outcome makes game playing an attractive and sensible option? “What I don’t want is to have a useless and heated conversation that creates bad feelings and doesn’t lead to change.” Third, present your brain with a more complex problem.

There is a third set of options out there that allows you to add meaning to the pool and build on the relationship.

At first, we thought that maybe there were places where dialogue couldn’t survive. But then we learned to ask: “Are you saying there isn’t anyone you know who is able to hold a high-risk conversation in a way that solves problems and builds relationships?” There usually is.

Blue highlight | Page: 48
As you consider what you want, notice when you start talking yourself into a Fool’s Choice. • Watch to see if you’re telling yourself that you must choose between peace and honesty, between winning and losing, and so on. • Break free of these Fool’s Choices by searching for the and. • Clarify what you don’t want, add it to what you do want, and ask your brain to start searching for healthy options to bring you to dialogue.

“Yeah,” your coworker explains, “I always watch two elements. When things start turning ugly, I watch the content of the conversation (the topic under discussion) along with the conditions (what people are doing in response). I look for and examine both what and why. If you can see why people are becoming upset or holding back their views or even going silent, you can do something to get back on track.”
                

Blue highlight | Page: 53
In truth, most of us do have trouble dual-processing (simultaneously watching for content and conditions)—especially when both stakes and emotions are high.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 54
Actually, it helps to watch for three different conditions: the moment a conversation turns crucial, signs that people don’t feel safe (silence or violence), and your own Style Under Stress. Let’s consider each of these conversation killers in turn.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 54
To help catch problems early, reprogram your mind to
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 54
pay attention to the signs that suggest you’re in a crucial conversation. Some people first notice physical signals—their stomach gets tight or their eyes get dry. Think about what happens to your body when conversations get tough. Everyone is a little bit different. What are your cues? Whatever they are, learn to look at them as signs to step back, slow down, and Start with Heart before things get out of hand.

People who are

gifted at dialogue keep a constant vigil on safety. They pay
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 55
When it’s safe, you can say anything. Here’s why gifted communicators keep a close eye on safety. Dialogue calls for the free flow of meaning—period. And nothing kills the flow of meaning like fear.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 55
This is a pretty remarkable claim. Think about it. We’re suggesting that people rarely become defensive simply because of what you’re saying. They only become defensive when they no longer feel safe. The problem is not the content of your message, but the condition of the conversation.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 56
On the other hand, if you don’t feel safe, you can’t take any feedback.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 56
It’s as if the pool of meaning has a lid on it. “What do you mean I look good? Is that some kind of joke? Are you insulting me?” When you don’t feel safe, even well-intended comments are suspect.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 56
When it’s unsafe, you start to go blind.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 57
As we’ve said before, when your emotions start cranking up, key brain functions start shutting down. Not only do you prepare to take flight, but your peripheral vision actually narrows. In fact, when you feel genuinely threatened, you can scarcely see beyond what’s right in front of you.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 57
By pulling yourself out of the content of an argument and looking for signs that safety is a risk, you reengage your brain and your full vision returns.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 57
As we suggested earlier, when you give your brain a new problem to consider (keep alert for signs that safety is at risk!), it affects your brain functioning. Your higher reasoning centers stay more active, and you’re far less likely to be dumbed down and far more likely to succeed in your crucial conversation.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 57
Don’t let safety problems lead you astray.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 57
Imagine the magnitude of what we’re suggesting here. We’re asking you to recode silence and violence as signs that people are feeling unsafe.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 57
We’re asking you to fight your natural tendency to respond in kind.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 57
We’re asking you to undo years of practice, maybe even eons of genetic shaping that prod you to take flight or pick a fight (when under attack), and recode the stimulus. “Ah, that’s a sign that the other person feels unsafe.” And then what? Do something to make it safe.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 58
Imagine increased influence, enhanced relationships, stronger teams, and more effective leadership. Turn on your capacity to recognize and respond to safety problems.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 58
In the next chapter we’ll explore how. For now, simply learn to look for safety, and then be curious, not angry or frightened.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 58
As people begin to feel unsafe, they start down one of two unhealthy paths. They move either to silence (withholding meaning from the pool) or to violence (trying to force
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 58
The three most common forms of silence are masking, avoiding, and withdrawing.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 60
The three most common forms are controlling, labeling, and attacking.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 62
Actually, no. Perhaps the most difficult element to watch closely as you’re madly dual-processing is your own behavior. Frankly,
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 62
Unfortunately, when you fail to monitor your own behavior, you can look pretty silly.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 75
The good realize that safety is at risk, but they fix it in exactly the wrong way.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 75
They try to make the subject more palatable by sugarcoating their message.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 75
The best don’t play games. Period.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 76
So they do something completely different. They step out of the content of the conversation, make it safe, and then step back in. Once safety is restored, they can talk about nearly anything.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 76
For example, Yvonne gets back on the path of dialogue by saying: “Can we change gears for a minute? I’d like to talk about what happens when we’re not romantically in sync. It would be good if we could both share what’s working and what isn’t. My goal isn’t to make you feel guilty, and I certainly don’t want to become defensive. What I’d really love is for us to come up with a solution that makes us both satisfied in our relationship.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 76
but because they believe the content (even if it’s delivered in a gentle way) suggests that you have a malicious intent.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 77
How can others feel safe when they believe you’re out to harm them? Soon, every word out of your mouth is suspect. You can’t utter a harmless “good morning” without others interpreting it in a negative way.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Mutual Purpose is the entry condition of dialogue. Find a shared goal, and you have both a good reason and a healthy climate for talking.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Watch for signs that Mutual Purpose is at risk. How do we
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Do others believe I care about their goals in this conversation? • Do they trust my motives?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 77
Remember the Mutual in Mutual Purpose. Just a word to the wise.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 78
What do I want for me? • What do I want for others? • What do I want for the relationship?

Look for the mutuality.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 78
Let’s say you’ve got a boss who frequently fails to keep commitments. How could you tell the boss you don’t trust him? Surely there’s no way to say this without the boss becoming defensive or vengeful, because he knows that your goal is merely to make your life better. To avoid disaster, find a Mutual Purpose that would be so motivating to the boss that he’d want to hear your concerns. If your only reason for approaching the boss is to get
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 78
what you want, the boss will hear you as critical and selfish—
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 78
which is what you are.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 78
Imagine raising the topic this way: “I’ve got some ideas for how I can be much more reliable and even reduce costs by a few thousand dollars in preparing the report each month. It’s going to be a bit of a sensitive conversation—but I think it will help a great deal if we can talk about it.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 79
While it’s true that there’s no reason to enter a crucial conversation if you don’t have Mutual Purpose, it’s equally true that you can’t stay in the conversation if you don’t maintain Mutual Respect. Mutual Respect is the continuance condition of dialogue. As people perceive that others don’t respect them, the conversation immediately becomes unsafe and dialogue comes to a screeching halt.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 79
Why? Because respect is like air. As long as it’s present, nobody thinks about it. But if you take it away, it’s all that people can think about. The instant people perceive disrespect in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the original purpose—it is now about defending dignity.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 79
Telltale signs. To spot when respect is violated and safety takes a turn south, watch for signs that people are defending their dignity.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 79
Emotions
                

Blue highlight | Page: 79
When people feel disrespected, they become highly charged. Their emotions turn from fear to anger. Then they resort to pouting, name-calling, yelling, and making threats. Ask the following question to determine when Mutual Respect is at risk:
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 80
Do others believe I respect them?
                

Blue highlight | Page: 80
How, they wonder, can they share the same purpose with people who come from completely different backgrounds or whose morals or values differ from theirs? What do you do, for example, if you’re upset because another person has let you down? And if this has repeatedly happened, how can you respect a person who is so poorly motivated and selfish?
                

Blue highlight | Page: 80
Dialogue truly would be doomed if we had to share every objective or respect every element of another person’s character before we could talk.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 80
However, we can stay in dialogue by finding a way to honor and regard another person’s basic humanity.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 80
In essence, feelings of disrespect often come when we dwell on how others are different from ourselves.
                
Note:Difference - disrespect

Blue highlight | Page: 80
We can counteract these feelings by looking for ways we are similar. Without excusing others’ behavior, we try to sympathize, even empathize, with them.

prayer—“Lord, help me forgive those who sin differently than I.”
                

Blue highlight | Page: 80
When we do this, we feel a kinship or mutuality between ourselves and even the thorniest of people.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 80
This sense of kinship and connection to others helps create Mutual Respect and eventually enables us to stay in dialogue with virtually anyone.

Each group was to go into a separate room and write out its goals for the company on flip-chart-sized paper.

After a few minutes the two groups returned to the training room. They were positively stunned. It was as if they had written the exact same lists. They didn’t merely share the shadow of an idea or two. Their aspirations were nearly identical. All wanted a profitable company, stable and rewarding jobs, high-quality products, and a positive impact on the community. Given a chance to speak freely and without fear of attack, each group laid out not simply what it wanted, but what virtually every person wanted.

Apologize • Contrast • Create a Mutual Purpose
                

Blue highlight | Page: 83
But you fail to restore safety. Why? Because now you feel disrespected. They’ve attacked you. So you stay stuck in the content of the conversation—thinking this has something to do with the factory tour.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 83
See their aggressive behavior for what it is—a sign of violated safety—

When you’ve made a mistake that has hurt others (e.g., you didn’t call the team), start with an apology. An apology is a statement that sincerely expresses your sorrow for your role in causing—or at least not preventing—pain or difficulty to others.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 84
Now, an apology isn’t really an apology unless you experience a change in heart. To offer a sincere apology, your motives have to change. You have to give up saving face, being right, or winning in order to focus on what you really want. You have to sacrifice a bit of your ego by admitting your error. But like many sacrifices, when you give up something you value, you’re rewarded with something even more valuable—healthy dialogue and better results.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 84
Sometimes others feel disrespected during crucial conversations even though you haven’t done anything disrespectful.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 84
But just as often, the insult is entirely unintended.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 85
When others misinterpret either your purpose or your intent, step out of the argument and rebuild safety by using a skill called Contrasting.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 85
Contrasting is a don’t/do statement that:
                

Blue highlight | Page: 85
Addresses others’ concerns that you don’t respect them or that you have a malicious purpose (the don’t part). • Confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose (the do part).
                

Blue highlight | Page: 85
[The don’t part] “The last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I don’t value the work you put in or that I didn’t want to share it with the VP. [The do part] I think your work has been nothing short of spectacular.”
                

Blue highlight | Page: 86
Of the two parts of Contrasting, the don’t is the more important because it deals with the misunderstanding that has put safety at risk.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 87
Contrasting provides context and proportion.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 87
you talk with your assistant about his lack
                

Blue highlight | Page: 88
At this point, you could be tempted to water down your content—“You know it’s really not that big a deal.” Don’t give into the temptation. Don’t take back what you’ve said. Instead, put your remarks in context.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 88
“Let me put this in perspective. I don’t want you to think I’m not satisfied with the quality of your work. I want us to continue working together. I really do think you’re doing a good job. This punctuality issue is important to me, and I’d just like you to work on that. If you will be more attentive to that, there are no other issues.”
                

Blue highlight | Page: 88
Use Contrasting for prevention or first aid. Contrasting can be useful both as prevention and as first aid for safety problems.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 88
So far our examples have helped us apply first
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 88
aid to a wounded conversation. Someone has taken something wrong, and we’ve intervened to clarify our true purpose or meaning. When we’re aware that something we’re about to drop into the pool of meaning
                

Blue highlight | Page: 88
When people misunderstand and you start arguing over the misunderstanding, stop. Use Contrasting. Explain what you don’t mean until you’ve restored safety. Then return to the conversation. Safety first.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 91
The worst at dialogue either ignore the problem and push ahead or roll over and let others have their way. They opt for either competition or submission. Both strategies end up making winners and losers, and the problem continues long beyond the initial conversation.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 91
The good at dialogue move immediately toward compromise. For example, the couple facing the transfer sets up two house-holds—one where the transferred spouse will be working and one where the family currently lives. Nobody really wants this arrangement, and frankly, it’s a pretty ugly solution that’s bound to lead to more serious problems, even divorce. While compromise is sometimes necessary,
                

Blue highlight | Page: 91
The best at dialogue use four skills to create a Mutual Purpose. If it helps you remember what to do, note that the four skills used in creating Mutual Purpose form the acronym CRIB.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 104
You make you mad. You make you scared, annoyed, or insulted. You and only you create your emotions.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 104
Claim two. Once you’ve created your upset emotions, you have only two options: You can act on them or be acted on by them. That is, when it comes to strong emotions, you either find a way to master them or fall hostage to them. Here’s how this all unfolds.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 106
The best at dialogue do something completely different. They aren’t held hostage by their emotions, nor do they try to hide or suppress them. Instead, they act on their emotions. That is, when they have strong
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 107
feelings, they influence (and often change) their emotions by thinking them out. As a result, they choose their emotions, and by so doing, make it possible to choose behaviors that create better results.

As it turns out, there is an intermediate step between what others do and how we feel.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 108
There’s always an intermediate step because actions themselves can’t and don’t cause emotional reactions. That’s why, when faced with the exact same circumstances, ten people may have ten different emotional responses. For instance, with a coworker like Louis, some might feel insulted whereas others merely feel curious. Some become angry and others feel concern or even sympathy.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 108
What is this intermediate step? Just after we observe what others do and just before we feel some emotion about it, we tell ourselves a story.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 108
We add meaning to the action we observed. We make a guess at the motive driving the behavior.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 108
Why were they doing that? We also add judgment—is that good or bad? And then, based on these thoughts or stories, our body responds with
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 108
an emotion.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 109
Stories provide our rationale for
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 109
what’s going on. They’re our interpretations of the facts. They help explain what we see and hear. They’re theories we use to explain why, how, and what. For instance, Maria asks: “Why does Louis take over? He doesn’t trust my ability to communicate. He thinks that because I’m a woman, people won’t listen to me.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 111
If we take control of our stories, they won’t control us. People who excel at dialogue are able to influence their emotions during crucial conversations. They recognize that while it’s true that at first we are in control of the stories we tell—after all, we do make them up of our own accord—once they’re told, the stories control us.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 111
But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can tell different stories and break the loop. In fact, until we tell different stories, we cannot break the loop.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 113
Not only do those who are best at crucial conversations notice when they’re slipping into silence or violence, but they’re also able to admit it.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 113
The moment they realize that they’re killing dialogue, they review their own Path to Action.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 113
Actually, identifying your emotions is more difficult than you might imagine. In fact, many people are emotionally illiterate. When asked to describe how they’re feeling, they use words such as “bad”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 113
or “angry” or “frightened”—which would be okay if these were accurate descriptors, but often they’re not.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 113
Individuals say they’re angry when, in fact, they’re feeling a mix of embarrassment and surprise. Or they suggest they’re unhappy when they’re feeling violated. Perhaps they suggest they’re upset when
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 114
they’re really feeling humiliated and cheated.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 114
Since life doesn’t consist of a series of vocabulary tests, you might wonder what difference words can make. But words do matter. Knowing what you’re really feeling helps you take a more accurate look at what is going on and why. For instance, you’re far
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 114
more likely to take an honest look at the story you’re telling yourself if you admit you’re feeling both embarrassed and surprised rather than simply angry.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 114
Meaning, of course, are you telling the right story? After all, feelings come from stories, and stories are our own invention.

The first step to regaining emotional control is to challenge the illusion that what you’re feeling is the only right emotion under the circumstances.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 114
This may be the hardest step, but it’s also the most important one.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 114
By questioning our feelings, we open ourselves up to question our stories. We challenge the comfortable conclusion that our story is right and true. We willingly question whether our emotions (very real), and the story behind them (only one of many possible explanations), are accurate.

As we said earlier, others could watch Maria’s interactions with Louis and walk away with different stories.

Test your ideas against a simple criterion: Can you see or hear this thing you’re calling a fact? Was it an actual behavior?

However, the statement “He doesn’t trust me” is a conclusion. It explains what you think, not what the other person did. Conclusions are subjective.

Either our stories are completely accurate and propel us in healthy directions, or they’re quite inaccurate but justify our current behavior

We call these imaginative and self-serving concoctions “clever stories.” They’re clever because they allow us to feel good about behaving badly. Better yet, they allow us to feel good about behaving badly even while achieving abysmal results. When we feel a need to justify
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 116
we tend to tell our stories in three very predictable ways. Learn what the three are and how to counteract them, and you can take control of your emotional
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 118
In Victim Stories we exaggerate our own innocence. In Villain Stories we overemphasize the other person’s guilt or stupidity.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 118
We automatically assume the worst possible motives or grossest incompetence while ignoring any possible good or neutral
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 118
intentions or skills a person may have.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 118
Labeling is a common device in Villain Stories. For example, “I can’t believe that bonehead gave me bad materials again.” By employing the handy label, we are now dealing not with a complex human being, but with a bonehead.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 118
After all, we can feel okay insulting or abusing a bonehead—whereas we might have to be more careful with a living, breathing person.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 118
Then when we fail to get the results we really want, we stay stuck in our ineffective behavior because, after all, look who we’re dealing with!
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 119
Finally come Helpless Stories. In
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 119
these fabrications we make ourselves out to be powerless to do anything healthy or helpful.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 119
We convince ourselves that there are no healthy alternatives for dealing with our predicament, which justifies the action we’re about to take.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 119
Villain and Victim Stories look back to explain why we’re in the situation we’re in, Helpless Stories look forward to explain why we can’t do anything to change our situation.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 119
helpless when we turn others’ behavior into fixed and unchangeable traits. For example, when we decide our colleague is a “control freak” (Villain Story), we are less inclined to give her feedback because, after all, control freaks like her don’t accept feedback (Helpless Story). Nothing we can do will change that fact.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 119
As you can see, Helpless Stories often stem from Villain Stories and typically offer us nothing more than Fool’s Choices— we can either be honest and ruin the relationship or stay silent and suffer.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 119
Clever stories match reality.

Turn villains into humans. When you find yourself labeling or otherwise vilifying others, stop and ask:
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 124
• Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do what this person is doing? This particular question humanizes others. As we search for plausible answers to it, our emotions soften. Empathy often replaces judgment, and depending upon how we’ve treated others, personal accountability replaces self-justification.

But what if she really were a reasonable, rational, and decent person? What if she had no motive other than to give you a hand? Isn’t it a bit early to be vilifying her? And if you do, don’t you run the risk of ruining a relationship?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 124
The purpose of the humanizing question is to deal with our own stories and emotions. It provides us with still another tool for working on ourselves first by providing a variety of possible reasons for the other person’s behavior.

In fact, with experience and maturity we learn to worry less about others’ intent and more about the effect others’ actions are having on us.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 124
And here’s the good news. When we reflect on alternative motives, not only do we soften our emotions, but equally important, we relax our absolute certainty long enough to allow for dialogue— the only reliable way of discovering others’ genuine motives.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 125
Turn the helpless into the able. Finally, when you catch yourself bemoaning your own helplessness, you can tell the complete story by returning to your original motive. To do so, stop and ask:

What do I really want? For me? For others? For the relationship? Then, kill the Fool’s Choice that’s made you feel helpless to choose anything other than silence or violence. Do this by asking:

When you refuse to make yourself helpless, you’re forced to hold yourself accountable for using your dialogue skills rather than bemoaning your weakness.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 126
As we tell the rest of the story, we free ourselves from the poisoning effects of unhealthy emotions. Best of all, as we regain control and move back to dialogue, we become masters of our own emotions rather than hostages.

Yellow highlight | Page: 131
So far we’ve gone to great pains to prepare ourselves to step up to and master crucial conversations. Here’s what we’ve learned. Our hearts need to be in the right place. We need to pay close attention to crucial conversations—particularly when people start feeling unsafe—and restore safety when necessary. And heaven forbid that we should tell ourselves clever and unhelpful stories.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 131
Most of the time, we walk into a discussion and slide into autopilot. “Hi, how are the kids? What’s going on at work?” What could be easier than talking? We know thousands of words and generally weave them into sentences that suit our needs. Most of the time.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 132
However, when stakes rise and our emotions kick in, well, that’s when we open our mouths and don’t do so well.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 132
In fact, as we suggested earlier, the more important the discussion, the less likely we are to be on our best behavior. More specifically, we advocate or express our views quite poorly.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 132
“I’m sorry, Marta, but people simply don’t like working with you. You’ve been asked to leave the special-projects team.” It’s one thing to argue that your company needs to shift from green to red packaging; it’s quite another to tell a person that he or she is offensive or unlikable. When the topic turns from things to people, it’s always more difficult, and to nobody’s surprise, some people are better at it than others.

The best at dialogue speak their minds completely and do it in a way that makes it safe for others to hear what they have to say and respond to it as well.

They are both totally frank and completely respectful.

if you know how to carefully blend three ingredients—confidence, humility, and skill.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 133
People who are skilled at dialogue have the confidence to say what needs to be said to the person who needs to hear it. They are confident that their opinions deserve to be placed in the pool of meaning. They are also confident that they can speak openly without brutalizing others or causing undue offense.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 133
Skilled people are confident that they have something to say, but also realize that others have valuable input. They are humble enough to realize that they don’t have a monopoly on the truth nor do they always have to win their way.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 134
This means they’re willing to both express their opinions and encourage others to do the same. Skill. Finally, people who willingly share delicate information are good at doing it. That’s why they’re confident in the first place. They don’t make a Fool’s Choice, because they’ve found a path that allows for both candor and safety. They speak the unspeakable, and people are grateful for their honesty.

Share your facts • Tell your story • Ask for others’ paths • Talk tentatively • Encourage testing

Of course, starting with our ugly stories is the most controversial, least influential, and most insulting way we could begin.

it. We hold it inside where the story builds up steam, and when we do eventually share our horrific story, we do so with a vengeance. The cycle starts all over again.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 138
Facts are the least controversial. Facts provide a safe beginning. By their very nature, facts aren’t controversial. That’s why we call them facts. For example, consider the statement: “Yesterday you arrived at work twenty minutes late.” No dispute there. Conclusions, on the other hand, are highly controversial. For example: “You can’t be trusted.” That’s hardly a fact. Actually, it’s more like an insult, and
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 138
Facts are the most persuasive. In addition to being less controversial, facts are also more persuasive than subjective conclusions. Facts form the foundation of belief. So if you want to persuade others, don’t start with your stories. Start with your observations. For example, which of the following do you find more persuasive?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 138
“I want you to stop sexually harassing me!” or   “When you talk to me, your eyes move up and down rather than look at my face. And sometimes you put your hand on my shoulder.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 139
When we start with shocking or offensive conclusions (“Quit groping me with your eyes!” or “I think we should declare bankruptcy”), we actually encourage others to tell Villain Stories about us. Since we’ve given them no facts to
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 139
support our conclusion, they make up reasons we’re saying these things. They’re likely to believe we’re either stupid or evil.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 139
And if you aren’t sure what your facts are (your story is absolutely filling your brain), take the time to think them through before you enter the crucial conversation. Take the time to sort out facts from conclusions. Gathering the facts is the homework required for crucial conversations. Facts are the least insulting. If you do want to share your story, don’t start with it. Your story (particularly if it has led to a rather ugly conclusion) could easily surprise and insult others. It could kill safety in one rash, ill-conceived sentence.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 140
Begin your path with facts. In order to talk about your stories, you need to lead the others involved down your Path to Action. Let them experience your path from the beginning to the end, and not from the end to—well, to wherever

Earn the right to share your story by starting with your facts. Facts lay the groundwork for all delicate conversations.

Sharing your story can be tricky. Even if you’ve started with your facts, the other person can still become defensive when you move from facts to stories. After all, you’re sharing potentially unflattering conclusions and judgments.

It takes confidence. To be honest, it can be difficult to share negative conclusions and unattractive judgments (e.g., “I’m wondering if you’re a thief”). It takes confidence to share such a potentially inflammatory story. However, if you’ve done your homework by thinking through the facts behind your story, you’ll realize that you are drawing
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 141
By thinking through the facts and then leading with them, you’re much more likely to have the confidence you need to add controversial and vitally important meaning to the shared pool.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 142
Look for safety problems. As you share your story, watch for signs that safety is deteriorating. If people start becoming defensive or appear to be insulted, step out of the conversation and rebuild safety by Contrasting.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 143
Be careful not to apologize for your views. Remember, the goal of Contrasting is not to water down your message, but to be sure that people don’t hear more than you intend. Be confident enough to share what you really want to

One of the ironies of dialogue is that, when talking with those holding opposing opinions, the more convinced and forceful you act, the more resistant others become. Speaking in absolute and overstated terms does not increase your influence, it decreases it. The converse is also true—the more tentatively you speak, the more open people become to your opinions.

Just right: “I don’t think you’re intending this, but I’m beginning to feel rejected.”

Safety becomes particularly important when you’re having a crucial conversation with people who might move to silence. Some people make Fool’s Choices in these circumstances. They worry that if they share their true opinions, others will clam up. So they choose between speaking their minds and hearing others out. But the best at dialogue don’t choose. They do both. They understand that the only limit to how strongly you can express your opinion is your willingness to be equally vigorous in encouraging others to challenge
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 146
Invite opposing views. So if you think others may be hesitant, make it clear that you want to hear their views—no matter how different. If others disagree, so much the better.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 147
“Does anyone see it differently?” “What am I missing here?” “I’d

really like to hear the other side of this story.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 147
Mean it. Sometimes people offer an invitation that sounds more like a threat than a legitimate call for opinions. “Well, that’s how I see it. Nobody disagrees, do they?”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 147
Play devil’s advocate. Occasionally you can tell that others are not buying into your facts or story, but they’re not speaking up either. You’ve sincerely invited them, even encouraged differing views, but nobody says anything. To help grease the skids, play devil’s advocate. Model disagreeing by disagreeing with your own view. “Maybe I’m wrong here. What if the opposite is true? What if the reason sales have dropped is because

It’s just that it might help put my mind to rest if we were to check on this right now.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 150
It starts with a story. When we feel the need to push our ideas on others, it’s generally because we believe we’re right and everyone else is wrong. There’s no need to expand the pool of meaning, because we own the pool. We also firmly believe it’s our duty to fight for the truth that we’re holding. It’s the honorable thing to do. It’s what people of character do.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 151
We use debating tricks that we’ve picked up throughout the years. Chief among them is the ability to “stack the deck.” We cite information that supports our ideas while hiding or discrediting anything that doesn’t.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 151
Then we spice things up with exaggeration: “Everyone knows that this is the only way to go.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 151
When this doesn’t work, we lace our language with inflammatory terms: “All right-thinking people would agree with me.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 151
We appeal to authority: “Well, that’s what the boss thinks.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 151
We draw hasty generalizations:
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 151
And again, the harder we try and the more forceful and nasty our tactics, the greater the resistance we create, the worse the results, and the more battered our relationships.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 151
When you find yourself just dying to convince others that your way is best, back off your current attack and think about what you really want for yourself, others, and the relationship. Then ask yourself, “How would I behave if these were the results I really wanted?” When your adrenaline level gets below the 0.05 legal limit, you’ll be able to use your STATE skills.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 152
First, Learn to Look. Watch for the moment when people start to resist you—perhaps they begin to raise their volume and/or overstate the facts behind their views in reaction to your tactics—or perhaps they retreat into silence. Turn your attention away from the topic (no matter how important) and onto yourself. Are you leaning forward? Are you speaking more loudly? Are you starting to try to win? Are you speaking in lengthy monologues and using dirty tricks? Remember: The more you care about an issue, the less likely you are to be on your best behavior.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 152
Of course, this isn’t easy. Backing off when we care the most is so counterintuitive that most of us have trouble doing so. It’s not easy to soften your language when you’re positive about something. And who wants to ask for other views when you know they’re wrong? That’s positively nuts.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 152
Let’s face it. When it comes to our strongest views, passion can be our enemy. Of course, feeling strongly about something isn’t bad in and of itself. It’s okay to have strong opinions. The problem comes when we try to express them.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 153
Catch yourself. So what’s a person to do? Catch yourself before you launch into a monologue. Realize that if you’re starting to feel indignant or if you can’t figure out why others don’t buy in—after all, it’s so obvious to you—recognize that you’re starting to enter dangerous territory. Back off your harsh and conclusive language. But don’t back off your belief. Hold to your belief; merely soften your approach.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 157
when most people become furious, we need to become curious. Rather than respond in kind, we need to wonder what’s behind the ruckus.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 157
But how? How can we possibly act curious when others are either attacking us or heading for cover? People who routinely seek to find out why others are feeling unsafe do so because they have learned that getting at the source of fear and discomfort is the best way to return to dialogue.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 157
Either they’ve seen others do it or they’ve stumbled on the formula themselves. Either way, they realize that the cure to silence or violence isn’t to respond in kind, but to get at the underlying source. This calls for genuine curiosity—at a time when you’re likely to be feeling frustrated or angry.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 158
Stay curious. When people begin to share their volatile stories and feelings, we now face the risk of pulling out our own Victim, Villain, and Helpless Stories to help us explain why they’re saying what they’re saying. Unfortunately, since it’s rarely fun to hear other people’s unflattering stories, we begin to assign negative motives to them for telling the stories. For example:
                

Blue highlight | Page: 159
To avoid overreacting to others’ stories, stay curious. Give your brain a problem to stay focused on. Ask: “Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person say this?” This question keeps you retracing the other person’s Path to Action until you see how it all fits together. And in most
                

Blue highlight | Page: 159
Be patient. When others are acting out their feelings and opinions through silence or violence, it’s a good bet they’re starting to feel the effects of adrenaline. Even if we do our best to safely and effectively respond to the other person’s verbal attack, we still have to face up to the fact that it’s going to take a little while for him or her to settle down. Say, for example, that a friend dumps out an ugly story and you treat it with respect and continue on with the conversation. Even if the two of you now share a similar view, it may seem like your friend is still pushing too hard. While it’s natural to move quickly from one thought to the next, strong emotions take a while to subside. Once the chemicals that fuel emotions are released, they hang around in the bloodstream for a time—in some cases, long after thoughts have changed.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 159
So be patient when exploring how others think and feel. Encourage them to share their path and then wait for their emotions to catch up with the safety that you’ve created.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 159
Once you’ve decided to maintain a curious approach, it’s time to help the other person retrace his or her Path to Action. Unfortunately, most of us fail to do so. That’s because when others start playing silence or violence games, we’re joining the conversation at the end of their Path to Action. They’ve seen and heard things, told themselves a story or two, generated a feeling (possibly a mix of fear and anger or disappointment), and now they’re starting to act out their story. That’s where we come in. Now, even though we may be hearing their first words, we’re coming in somewhere near the end of their path. On the Path to

Every sentence has a history.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 161
Break the cycle. And then guess what happens? When we’re on the receiving end of someone’s retributions, accusations, and cheap shots, rarely do we think: “My, what an interesting story he or she must have told. What do you suppose led to that?” Instead, we match this unhealthy behavior. Our genetically shaped, eons-old defense mechanisms kick in, and we create our own hasty and ugly Path to Action.

As you watch families and work groups take part in heated debates, it’s common to notice a rather intriguing phenomenon. Although the various parties you’re observing are violently arguing, in truth, they’re in violent agreement. They actually agree on every important point, but they’re still fighting. They’ve found a way to turn subtle differences into a raging debate.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 171
Most arguments consist of battles over the 5 to 10 percent of the facts and stories that people disagree over. And while it’s true that people eventually need to work through differences, you shouldn’t start there. Start with an area of agreement.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 171
So here’s the take-away. If you completely agree with the other person’s path, say so and move on. Agree when you agree. Don’t turn an agreement into an argument.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 171
Of course, the reason most of us turn agreements into debates is because we disagree with a certain portion of what the other person has said. Never mind that it’s a minor portion. If it’s a point of disagreement, we’ll jump all over it like a fleeing criminal.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 171
it first is even better. And of course, having it first after others are wrong endows you with an even greater glory! Over time you find that finding even the tiniest of errors in others’ facts, thinking, or logic reinforces your supreme place in the spotlight of teacher and peer admiration. So you point out their errors. Being right at the expense of others becomes skillful sport.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 171
On the other hand, when you watch people who are skilled in dialogue, it becomes clear that they’re not playing this everyday game of Trivial Pursuit—looking for trivial differences and then proclaiming them aloud. In fact, they’re looking for points of agreement. As a result, they’ll often start with the words “I agree.” Then they talk about the part they agree with. At least, that’s where they start.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 172
Now when the other person has merely left out an element of the argument, skilled people will agree and then build. Rather than saying: “Wrong. You forgot to mention . . .,” they say: “Absolutely. In addition, I noticed that. .
                

Blue highlight | Page: 172
If you agree with what has been said but the information is incomplete, build. Point out areas of agreement, and
                

Blue highlight | Page: 172
then add elements that were left out of the discussion.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 172
Finally, if you do disagree, compare your path with the other person’s. That is, rather than suggesting that he or she is wrong, suggest that you differ. He or she may, in fact, be wrong, but you don’t know for sure until you hear both sides of the story. For now, you just know that the two of you differ. So instead of pronouncing “Wrong!” start with a tentative but candid opening, such as “I think I see things differently. Let me describe how.”
                

Blue highlight | Page: 172
In summary, to help remember these skills, think of your ABCs. Agree when you agree. Build when others leave out key pieces. Compare when you differ. Don’t turn differences into debates that lead to unhealthy relationships and bad results.

Blue highlight | Page: 179
Both of these problems are solved if, before making a decision, the people involved decide how to decide. Don’t allow people to assume that dialogue is decision making. Dialogue is a process for getting all relevant meaning into a shared pool. That process, of course, involves everyone. However, simply because everyone is allowed to share their meaning—actually encouraged to share their meaning—doesn’t mean they are then guaranteed to take part in making all the decisions. To avoid violated expectations, separate dialogue from decision making. Make it clear how decisions will be made—who will be involved and why.

Consulting is a process whereby decision makers invite others to influence them before they make their choice.

Consensus This method can be both a great blessing and a frustrating curse. Consensus means you talk until everyone honestly agrees to one decision. This method can produce tremendous unity and high-quality decisions. If misapplied, it can also be a horrible waste of time. It should only be used with (1) high-stakes and complex issues or (2) issues where everyone absolutely must support the final choice.

assignment, clarify up front the exact details of what you want. Couples get into trouble in this area when one of the parties doesn’t want to take the time to think carefully about the “deliverables” and then later on becomes upset because his or her unstated desires weren’t met. Have you ever remodeled a room with a loved one? Then you know what we’re talking about. Better to spend the time up front clarifying exactly what you want rather than waste resources and hurt feelings on the back end.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 186
It’s shocking how often people leave this element out of an assignment. Instead of giving a deadline, people simply point to the setting sun of “someday.” With vague or unspoken deadlines, other urgencies come up, and the assignment finds its way to the bottom of the pile, where it is soon forgotten. Assignments without deadlines are far better at producing guilt than stimulating action. Goals without deadlines aren’t goals; they’re merely directions.

Remember, if you want people to feel accountable, you must give them an opportunity to account. Build an expectation for follow-up into every assignment.

When you feel a measure of respect for the other person, you’re ready to begin. After establishing a Mutual Purpose for the exchange, STATE your path. For example:

“I’d like to talk about something that’s getting in the way of my working with you. It’s a tough issue to bring up, but I think it’ll help us be better teammates if I do. Is that okay?” [Establish Mutual Purpose]
                

Blue highlight | Page: 192
This is generally a problem of not knowing how to STATE Your Path. When something bothers you, catch it early. Contrasting can also help. “I’m not trying to blow this out of proportion. I just want to deal with it before it gets out of hand.” Describe the specific behaviors you’ve observed.

Fortunately for us, after analyzing their results, Mandel and Johnson were in a position to deliver a stunningly simple answer to the “Yeah, but how?” question. In an article largely overlooked since it was published in 2002, they described how they were able to draw website visitors’ attention to the goal of comfort merely by placing fluffy clouds on the background wallpaper of the site’s landing page. That maneuver led those visitors to assign elevated levels of importance to comfort when asked what they were looking for in a sofa. Those same visitors also became more likely to search the site for information about the comfort features of the sofas in stock and, most notably, to choose a more comfortable (and more costly) sofa as their preferred purchase. To make sure their results were due to the landing page wallpaper and not to some general human preference for comfort, Mandel and Johnson reversed their procedure for other visitors, who saw wallpaper that pulled their attention to the goal of economy by depicting pennies instead of clouds. These visitors assigned greater levels of importance to price, searched the site primarily for cost information, and preferred an inexpensive sofa.

The surprising lesson of this story: Highly creative ads are more predictable than uncreative ones. It’s like Tolstoy’s quote: “All happy families resemble each other, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” All creative ads resemble one another, but each loser is uncreative in its own way.

if creative ads consistently make use of the same basic set of templates, perhaps “creativity” can be taught. Perhaps even novices—with no creative experience—could produce better ideas if they understood the templates.

This is a stunning improvement for a two-hour investment in learning a few basic templates! It appears that there are indeed systematic ways to produce creative ideas.

But isn’t the use of a template or a checklist confining? Surely we’re not arguing that a “color by numbers” approach will yield more creative work than a blank-canvas approach?

We’ve already built those muscles—the concept of JFK, and all its associations, is already embedded in our memories. What we’re remembering is simply a pointer to this information—we’re posting a little flag on the terrain of our memory. With the raw letters, we’re posting three separate flags. In the end, it’s one bit of information (or one flag) versus three, and it’s no surprise that one is easier to remember.

The most basic way to get someone’s attention is this: Break a pattern. Humans adapt incredibly quickly to consistent patterns.

Yellow highlight | Page: 65
This chapter focuses on two essential questions: How do I get people’s attention? And, just as crucially, How do I keep it?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 65
To understand the answers to these two questions, we have to understand two essential emotions—surprise and interest—that are commonly provoked by naturally sticky ideas.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 67
Our schemas are like guessing machines. Schemas help us predict what will happen and, consequently, how we should make decisions.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 67
Emotions are elegantly tuned to help us deal with critical situations.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 67
For instance, a secondary effect of being angry, which was recently discovered by researchers, is that we become more certain of our judgments. When we’re angry, we know we’re right, as anyone who has been in a relationship can attest.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 67
So if emotions have biological purposes, then what is the biological purpose of surprise? Surprise jolts us to attention. Surprise is triggered when our schemas fail, and it prepares us to understand why the failure occurred. When our guessing machines fail, surprise grabs our attention so that we can repair them for the future.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 68
a book called Unmasking the Face, Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen coined a term, “the surprise brow,” to

When our brows go up, it widens our eyes and gives us a broader field of vision—the surprise brow is our body’s way of forcing us to see more.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 68
Unexpected ideas are more likely to stick because surprise makes us pay attention and think.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 68
Surprise can prompt us to hunt for underlying causes, to imagine other possibilities, to figure out how to avoid surprises in the future.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 71
The emotion of surprise is designed to focus our attention on the failure, so that we can improve our guessing machines for the future. Then we drew a distinction between gimmicky surprise, like dot-com ads, and meaningful post-dictable surprise.

“In that instant I realized that journalism was not just about regurgitating the facts but about figuring out the point. It wasn’t enough to know the who, what, when, and where; you had to understand what it meant. And why it mattered.”

“I also found something I had not expected—the most successful of these pieces all began with a mystery story. The authors described a state of affairs that seemed to make no sense and then invited the reader into the material as a way of solving the mystery.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 81
Mysteries are powerful, Cialdini says, because they create a need for closure. “You’ve heard of the famous Aha! experience, right?” he says. “Well, the Aha! experience is much more satisfying when it is preceded by the Huh? experience.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 81
Cialdini began to create mysteries in his own classroom, and the power of the approach quickly became clear.

“Normally five to ten minutes before the scheduled end time, some students start preparing to leave. You know the signals—pencils are put away, notebooks folded, backpacks zipped up.”
                

Blue highlight | Page: 82
Cialdini believes that a major benefit of teaching using mysteries is that “the process of resolving mysteries is remarkably similar to the process of science.” So, by using mysteries, teachers don’t just heighten students’ interest in the day’s material; they train them to think like scientists.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 82
Mystery is created not from an unexpected moment but from an unexpected journey. We know where we’re headed—we want to solve the mystery—but we’re not sure how we’ll get there.

McKee says, “Curiosity11 is the intellectual need to answer questions and close open patterns. Story plays to this universal desire by doing the opposite, posing questions and opening situations.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 83
In McKee’s view, a great script is designed so that every scene is a Turning Point. “Each Turning Point hooks curiosity. The audience wonders, What will happen next? and How will it turn out?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 83
McKee notes that the How will it turn out? question is powerful enough to keep us watching even when we know better. “Think of all the bad films you’ve sat through just to get the answer to that nagging question.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 84
In 1994, George Loewenstein,12 a behavioral economist at Carnegie Mellon University, provided the most comprehensive account of situational interest. It is surprisingly simple. Curiosity, he says, happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 84
Loewenstein argues that gaps cause pain.

Pokémon cards cause kids to wonder, Which characters am I missing?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 85
One important implication of the gap theory is that we need to open gaps before we close them. Our tendency is to tell people the facts. First, though, they must realize that they need these facts. The trick to convincing people that they need our message, according to Loewenstein, is to first highlight some specific knowledge that they’re missing. We can pose a question or puzzle that confronts people with a gap in their knowledge.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 85
We can point out that someone else knows something they don’t. We can present them with situations that have unknown resolutions, such as elections, sports events, or mysteries. We can challenge them to predict an outcome (which creates two knowledge gaps—What will happen? and Was I right?).

They work because they tease you with something that you don’t know—in fact, something that you didn’t care about at all, until you found out that you didn’t know it. “Is my daughter strung out on one of my old prescriptions? I wonder if I ate at the restaurant with the slime?
                

Blue highlight | Page: 86
In improving this message, we need to think about how to elicit interest rather than force-feeding facts.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 87
This approach is inspired by the gap theory. The goal is not to summarize; it’s to make you care about knowing something, and then to tell you what you want to know.
                

Blue highlight | Page: 87
The improvement here is driven by structure, not content. Let’s face it, this is not a particularly interesting mystery. It would never make an episode of Law & Order. But our minds are extremely generous when it comes to mysteries—the format is inherently appealing.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 88
The news-teaser approach can be used with all sorts of ideas in all sorts of contexts. To make our communications more effective, we need to shift our thinking from “What information do I need to convey?” to “What questions do I want my audience to ask?”

know. One complication is that people tend to think they know a lot.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 88
If people believe they know everything, it’s hard to make the gap theory work. Fortunately, there are strategies for combating overconfidence. For instance, Nora Ephron’s journalism teacher prevented overconfidence by causing the students’ schemas of journalism to fail. He made them commit to their preconceived ideas and then pulled the rug out from under them.

Eric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard, came up with a pedagogical innovation known as “concept testing.” Every so often in his classes, Mazur will pose a conceptual question and then ask his students to vote publicly on the answer. The simple act of committing to an answer makes the students more engaged and more curious about the outcome.

The thirst to fill a knowledge gap—to find out who was right—can be more powerful than the thirst for slides and jungle gyms.

If curiosity arises from knowledge gaps, we might assume that when we know more, we’ll become less curious because there are fewer gaps in our knowledge.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 89
But Loewenstein argues that the opposite is true. He says that as we gain
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 89
information we are more and more likely to focus on what we don’t know. Someone who knows the state capitals of 17 of 50 states may be proud of her knowledge. But someone who knows 47 may be more likely to think of herself as not knowing 3 capitals.

The trick, Arledge said, was to give people enough context about the game so that they’d start to care.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 91
Arledge intuitively made use of Loewenstein’s gap theory. How do you get people interested in a topic? You point out a gap in their knowledge. But what if they lack so much knowledge about, say, the Georgia Bulldogs, that they’ve got more of an abyss than a gap? In that case, you have to fill in enough knowledge to make the abyss into a gap.

The tool kit he developed for NCAA football stood the test of time. The way to get people to care is to provide context. Today that seems obvious, because these techniques have become ubiquitous.

Clearly, Aesop was illustrating a universal human shortcoming. The fable would not have survived for more than 2,500 years if it didn’t reflect some profound truth about human nature.

Language is often abstract, but life is not abstract. Teachers teach students about battles and animals and books. Doctors repair problems with our stomachs, backs, and hearts. Companies create software, build planes, distribute newspapers; they build cars that are cheaper, faster, or fancier than last year’s. Even the most abstract business strategy must eventually show up in the tangible actions of human beings. It’s easier to understand those tangible actions than to understand an abstract strategy statement—just as it’s easier to understand a fox dissing some grapes than an abstract commentary about the human psyche.

Yale researcher Eric Havelock3 studies tales that have been passed down by word of mouth, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey. He notes that these tales are characterized by lots of concrete actions, with few abstractions. Why? The ancient Greeks certainly had no problem with abstraction—this was the society that produced Plato and Aristotle, after all. Havelock believes that the stories evolved away from abstraction over time. When they were passed along from generation to generation, the more memorable concrete details survived and the abstractions evaporated.

To be simple—to find our core message—is quite difficult. (It’s certainly worth the effort, but let’s not kid ourselves that it’s easy.) Crafting our ideas in an unexpected way takes a fair amount of effort and applied creativity. But being concrete isn’t hard, and it doesn’t require a lot of effort. The barrier is simply forgetfulness—we forget that we’re slipping into abstractspeak. We forget that other people don’t know what we know. We’re the engineers who keep flipping back to our drawings, not noticing that the assemblers just want us to follow them down to the factory floor.

Testable credentials are useful in many domains. For example, take the question “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?” Ronald Reagan famously posed this question to the audience during his 1980 presidential debate with Jimmy Carter.

It’s not always obvious which wellspring of credibility we should draw from. What Marshall showed so brilliantly was perseverance—knowing when it was time to draw on a different well. In this chapter we’ve seen that the most obvious sources of credibility—external validation and statistics—aren’t always the best. A few vivid
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 164
details might be more persuasive than a barrage of statistics. An antiauthority might work better than an authority. A single story that passes the Sinatra Test might overcome a mountain of skepticism. It’s inspirational to know that a medical genius like Marshall had to climb over the same hurdles with his idea as we’ll have to climb with ours—and to see that he eventually prevailed, to the benefit of us all.

The researchers theorized that thinking about statistics shifts people into a more analytical frame of mind. When people think analytically, they’re less likely to think emotionally. And the researchers believed it was people’s emotional response to Rokia’s plight that led them to act.

When people were primed to feel before they read about Rokia, they gave $2.34, about the same as before. But when they were primed to calculate before they read about Rokia, they gave $1.26.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 167
These results are shocking. The mere act of calculation reduced people’s charity. Once we put on our analytical hat, we react to emotional appeals differently. We hinder our ability to feel.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 168
IN THE LAST chapter, we discussed how to convince people that our ideas are credible, how to make them believe. Belief counts for a lot, but belief isn’t enough. For people to take action, they have to care.

Rather, the goal of making messages “emotional” is to make people care. Feelings inspire people to act.

It’s important, Caples says, to keep the self in self-interest: “Don’t say, ‘People will enjoy12 a sense of security when they use Goodyear Tires.’ Say, ‘You enjoy a sense of security when you use Goodyear Tires.’

avoid talking about abstract benefits (“People will enjoy a sense of security when they use Goodyear Tires”) and focus on personal benefits (“You enjoy a sense of security when you use Goodyear Tires”).

The second question tested two versions of his greed appeal: “Would your firefighters prefer a large electric popcorn popper or an excellent set of chef’s carving knives as a thank-you for reviewing the film?” The first two calls yielded definitive answers to this question: “Do you think we’d use a fire safety program because of some #*$@%! popcorn popper?!” The marketer stopped asking about the free gifts.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 189
But self-interest isn’t the whole story. Principles—equality, individualism, ideals about government, human rights, and the like—may matter to us even when they violate our immediate self-interest.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 189
And perhaps the most important part of the story is this: “Group interest” is often a better predictor of political opinions than self-interest. Kinder says that in forming opinions people seem to ask not “What’s in it for me?” but, rather, “What’s in it for my group?” Our group affiliation may be based on race, class, religion, gender, region, political party, industry, or countless other dimensions of difference.

This model is the standard view of decision-making in economics classes: People are self-interested and rational.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 190
The second model is quite different. It assumes that people make decisions based on identity. They ask themselves three questions: Who am I? What kind of situation is this?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 190
And what do people like me do in this kind of situation?

There are no calculations, only norms and principles. Which sofa would someone like me—a Southeastern accountant—be more likely to buy? Which political candidate should a Hollywood Buddhist get behind?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 191
But from the perspective of the identity model of decision-making, turning down the popper makes perfect sense. The thought process would be more like this: “I’m a firefighter. You’re offering me a popcorn popper to get me to view a film on safety. But firefighters aren’t the kind of people who need little gifts to motivate us to learn about safety. We risk our lives, going into burning buildings to save people. Shame on you for implying that I need a popcorn popper!”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 191
to unite these two decision models. What if the marketer had offered to donate fifty dollars to a school’s fire-safety program in exchange for the firemen’s viewing the film? It’s less clear that this offer would have violated the firefighters’ sense of identity.

The first is decision paralysis—the anxiety and irrationality that can emerge from excessive choice or ambiguous situations. Think about the students who missed both a fantastic lecture and a great film because they couldn’t decide which one was better, or how hard it was for Jeff Hawkins, the leader of the Palm Pilot development group, to get his team to focus on a few issues rather than on many. To beat decision paralysis, communicators have to do the hard work of finding the core.

Yellow highlight | Page: 244
The Curse of Knowledge is a worthy adversary, because in some sense it’s inevitable. Getting a message across has two stages: the Answer stage and the Telling Others stage. In the Answer stage, you use your expertise to arrive at the idea that you want to share. Doctors study for a decade to be capable of giving the Answer. Business managers may deliberate for months to arrive at the Answer.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 245
Here’s the rub: The same factors that worked to your advantage in the Answer stage will backfire on you during the Telling Others stage. To get the Answer, you need expertise, but you can’t dissociate expertise from the Curse of Knowledge. You know things that others don’t know, and you can’t remember what it was like not to know those things. So when you get around to sharing the Answer, you’ll tend to communicate as if your audience were you.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 245
There is a curious disconnect between the amount of time we invest in training people how to arrive at the Answer and the amount of time we invest in training them how to Tell Others.

CHARISMATIC BEHAVIOR CAN be broken down into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 225
In order to be charismatic, we need to choose mental states that make our body language, words, and behaviors flow together and express the three core elements of charisma.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 285
When you’re fully present, it shows in your body language in a highly charisma-enhancing way.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 286
Being charismatic does not depend on how much time you have but on how fully present you are in each interaction.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 288
The people you’re with feel that they have your full attention and that they are the most important thing in the world to you at that moment.

“In most moments we have a continuous internal commentary on what is happening and what we should do next. We might greet a friend with a hug, but the warmth of our greeting becomes blurred by our computations about how long to embrace or what we’re going to say when we’re done. We rush through the motions, not fully present.” Being present enables you to fully notice and drink in the good moments.

We look for clues of power in someone’s appearance, in others’ reaction to this person, and, most of all, in the person’s body language.

others. Warmth tells us whether or not people will want to use whatever power they have in our favor.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 310
Warmth is assessed almost entirely through body language and behavior; it’s evaluated more directly than power.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 322
warmth. The combination of power and warmth would have been very rare and very, very precious:
                

Pink highlight | Location: 327
From lab experiments to neuroimaging, research has consistently shown that they are the two dimensions we evaluate first and foremost in assessing other people.3 Both power and warmth are necessary conditions for charisma.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 341
Though this may sound incredible—how could words carry so little weight compared to the body language of the person delivering them?—it actually makes sense. In the scope of human evolution, language is a relatively recent invention.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 344
This is why nonverbal communication has a far greater impact.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 359
The second consequence is that our body language expresses our mental state whether we like it or not.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 364
(remember, people can read your face in as little as seventeen milliseconds).
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 375
Thus, the first step in learning charisma—and what the first part of this book is all about—is developing the various mental states that produce charismatic body language and behaviors.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 389
Individuals with strong internal skills are aware of what exactly is happening inside them and know how to handle
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 399
“To know others is knowledge. To know oneself is wisdom.”
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 400
Knowing your internal world starts with one key insight upon which all charisma is built: your mind can’t tell fact from fiction. This is the one dimension of your internal world that can help you get into the right charismatic mental state at will, and almost instantly.

critical. Get the internal state right, and the right charismatic behaviors and body language will pour forth automatically.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 472
In fact, that’s probably exactly what will happen, because most of us tend to interpret events—whether they’re personal or impersonal—as relating to us.

When interacting with someone, assume that he or she will feel (at least on a subconscious level) that whatever you do relates to him or to her.

For many of us, a state of doubt or uncertainty is an uncomfortable place to be.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 526
Our inability to tolerate uncertainty carries multiple costs.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 529
Anxiety is a serious drawback to charisma. First, it impacts our internal state: quite obviously, it’s hard to be fully present while you’re feeling anxious. Anxiety can also lower our confidence. Anxiety, low presence, and low confidence can show up directly in our body language, as well as reduce our ability to emanate warmth.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 531
Yet if there’s one thing that’s certain, it’s that uncertainty isn’t going away.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 533
Those who are better at handling it will gain a distinctive advantage over others.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 537
But how many of us have felt our minds going over the different outcomes again and again, rehashing the various plans we’ve made, replaying possible scenarios, mentally rehearsing the upcoming conversations not just once or twice but ad nauseam?
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 547
The reason Tom couldn’t let go is that our minds are fundamentally uncomfortable with uncertainty.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 548
The minute our brain registers ambiguity, it flashes an error signal. Uncertainty registers as a tension: something that must be corrected before we can feel comfortable again.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 549
Our natural discomfort with uncertainty is yet another legacy of our survival instincts. We tend to be more comfortable with what is familiar, which obviously hasn’t killed us yet, than with what is unknown or uncertain, which could turn out to be dangerous.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 552
the ability to be comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity turns out to be one of the strongest predictors of success in business.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 558
The single most effective technique I’ve found to alleviate the discomfort of uncertainty is the responsibility transfer.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 577
If you did feel something happen, fantastic: you’ve just performed a responsibility transfer.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 580
The reason this technique works is that when presented with a scenario, our brain’s first reaction is to consider it as possible.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 585
may last only a brief moment, it’s enough to produce an emotional and physical reassurance,
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 591
However, the responsibility transfer works without trying to negate uncertainty. Instead, it helps you to be less affected by it, drawing you out of the negative mental and physical states that often accompany a position of not knowing.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 593
By presenting your mind with the possibility that responsibility has been transferred, you’re putting to good use the wonderful placebo effect—the brain’s inability to distinguish between imagination and reality.

Dissatisfaction Caused by Comparison
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 611
Human beings are by nature driven to compare.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 614
The very act of comparing and evaluating hinders our ability to be fully present.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 616
And a negative evaluation can easily put us in a negative mental state, such as dissatisfaction, envy, or resentment.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 623
Few things impact people’s performance more than how they feel about themselves.

Athletes will tell you that a bad mental state will affect their performance no matter how well prepared they are physically. Psychological negativity can have real physical consequences.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 625
When our internal voice starts criticizing us, lashing out, it can feel like we’re under attack. Because our brain doesn’t distinguish between imagination and reality, these internal attacks are perceived by our mind just as a real, physical attack would be, and they can generate an automatic physical reaction known as the threat response or fight-or-flight response.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 628
The effects of this activation are well-known. Just as a zebra reacts to the stress of being chased by a lion, the human body shoots adrenaline and cortisol (stress hormones) through its veins, and directs all its resources toward crucial functions: elevated heart and breathing rates, muscle reaction, vision acuity, and so forth. The body is no longer concerned with living ten more years, but with surviving ten more minutes. It shuts down nonurgent functions such as muscle repair, digestion, and the immune system,
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 633
In other words, because it’s not critical to survival, intelligent thinking gets shut down.
                

Pink highlight | Location: 633
David Rock, founder of the NeuroLeadership Institute, explains that “the threat response impairs analytic thinking, creative insight, and problem solving.”7 This kind of negativity doesn’t just affect our actual performance, it also affects how others perceive us.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 639
No matter how brief that negative expression, the person facing you is going to spot it. And all they know is that while you were looking at them and listening to them, a negative expression crossed your face. Naturally they’ll assume that expression was a reaction to them—what they said or did, or what you thought about them. This is how internal negativity affects your body language, and thus your charisma, in addition to your performance.

Yellow highlight | Location: 654
But already, just knowing the universality of such feelings can help us neutralize their effect and reduce their power.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 668
The difficult feelings we experience are a natural by-product of one of our most useful survival mechanisms.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 669
Feelings like fear or anxiety are designed to get you to do something. They’re uncomfortable because they’re “designed” to be uncomfortable.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 706
Feeling internal discomfort and negativity is a natural part of life. Everyone experiences it.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 713
we feel they “shouldn’t” be happening. So not only do we feel bad, we then also feel bad about feeling bad.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 735
The brain equates social needs with survival; being hungry and being ostracized activate similar neural responses.1 Somewhere in the back of our minds is the fear of being so disapproved-of that we’d be excluded by those who matter to our survival.

Yellow highlight | Location: 785
are usually the most negative ones. This tendency is called the negativity bias, and

failure is seldom fatal, and just realizing that even the worst-case scenario is survivable can bolster your confidence.

thoughts. We want to avoid falling into the trap of arguing with them or trying to suppress them.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 837
Because trying to suppress a self-critical thought only makes it more central to your thinking, it’s a far better strategy to simply aim to neutralize it.

Deciding to change your belief about what happened (technically called cognitive reappraisal) effectively decreases the brain’s stress levels.

The researchers concluded that deciding to change beliefs was a far more effective and healthier solution than attempting to repress or ignore emotions.4 In most situations, we don’t know for certain what motivates a person’s actions, so we might as well choose the explanation that is most helpful to us and create a version of events that gets us into the specific mental state we need for charisma.

Once again, we can thank the brain’s tendency to accept imagination as reality.

Being comfortable with discomfort.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 996
The answer, surprisingly, is to delve into those very sensations of discomfort. That’s right. Though it sounds counterintuitive, rather than trying to suppress, ignore, or power through them, your goal is to give your full attention to the very sensations you’d instinctively want to push away.

Just by using the right mental images, your subconscious mind will send a remarkable chain reaction of confidence signals cascading through your body. In fact, you can display nearly any body language just by picking the right visualization.

The next time you do this exercise, aim to create images that are even more detailed. Guided imagery must be precise, vivid, and detailed to be effective, says Harvard-trained visualization specialist Stephen Krauss.

Visualization is truly a miracle method, helping you boost confidence, emanate more warmth, replace anxiety with calm serenity, or gain access to whichever emotion you’d like to feel and then broadcast it through your body language.

I’ve even found visualization helpful before writing important e-mails.

Higher self-compassion predicts a greater sense of personal responsibility for the outcome of events: it helps predict levels of accountability. People who score high on self-compassion also have a lower tendency for denial. This makes sense: personal mistakes would generate less self-criticism, so people would be more willing to admit to them.

self-compassion is feeling that what happened to you is unfortunate, whereas self-pity is feeling that what happened to you is unfair. In this way, self-pity can lead to resentment or bitterness, and to feeling more isolated and alienated. In contrast, self-compassion often leads to increased feelings of connectedness.

I was walking up the Gran Via in Madrid, feeling tired, hungry, lonely, unfashionably dressed, and the epitome of an ugly American. The attitude was definitely not working for me, so what to do? I decided that I was a movie star incognito. I stood up straighter, shoulders back, head erect, with the posture that I imagine I would have if I were royalty. Suddenly the dress that had seemed so out of place a moment ago felt like an amazing fashion statement, something that everyone else should copy. I noticed as I walked down the street that heads were turning, all of them. When I asked a man for directions, he said he would be honored if I would allow him to show me the way. It was amazing. From one second to the next, I went from a dowdy, frumpy, ugly stranger to a head-turning movie star. It was memorable. And enlightening.

The Power of Moments: Why Certain Experiences Have Extraordinary Impact

Yellow highlight | Location: 234
Moments matter.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 235
All it takes is a bit of insight and fore-thought.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 252
To avoid this kind of oversight, we must understand when special moments are needed. We must learn to think in moments, to spot the occasions that are worthy of investment.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 254
This “moment-spotting” habit can be unnatural. In organizations, for instance, we are consumed with goals. Time is meaningful only insofar as it clarifies or measures our goals. The goal is the thing.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 255
But for an individual human being, moments are the thing. Moments are what we remember and what we cherish. Certainly we might celebrate achieving a goal, such as completing a marathon or landing a significant client—but the achievement is embedded in a moment.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 261
We’ll explore three situations that deserve punctuation: transitions, milestones, and pits.

That logic shows why the first day of work is an experience worth investing in. For new employees, it’s three big transitions at once: intellectual (new work), social (new people), and environmental (new place).
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 342
So “fresh starts” happen not only on New Year’s Day, but also on any other landmark date. If you’re struggling to make a transition, create a defining moment that draws a dividing line between Old You and New You.

Transitions should be marked, milestones commemorated, and pits filled.

The point we’re emphasizing here is that certain circumstances demand attention.

Times to be savored. Moments that make us feel engaged, joyful, amazed, motivated. They are peaks.

“Bad Is Stronger than Good.”
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 698
So, when it comes to the way service executives think, it’s not surprising that bad is stronger than good. Their attention is naturally drawn to the customers who had the worst experiences. But in indulging that instinct, they miss an enormous opportunity. To be clear,

How do you build peaks? You create a positive moment with elements of elevation, insight, pride, and/or connection.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 707
To elevate a moment, do three things: First, boost sensory appeal. Second, raise the stakes. Third, break the script.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 741
Why? It’s no one’s job, and it’s a hassle, and there’s always something happening that seems more urgent. This same dynamic is what makes it so hard to create peaks in our personal lives as well.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 749
We’re not trying to pop your balloon. Rather, we want to build your determination: It’s going to be way harder than you think to create peaks. But once you’ve done it, you’re going to consider every ounce of effort worth it. You will have created your own defining moments.

By breaking the script, we can lay down a richer set of memories. As the authors of the book Surprise put it, “We feel most comfortable when things are certain, but we feel most alive when they’re not.”

When you have a sudden realization, one that you didn’t see coming, and one that you know viscerally is right, you’ve tripped over the truth.

CLTS facilitators see the problem vividly, but they don’t share their concerns directly. They let the villagers see for themselves. The “aha!” moment should always happen in the minds of the audience.

This three-part recipe—a (1) clear insight (2) compressed in time and (3) discovered by the audience itself—provides a blueprint for us when we want people to confront uncomfortable truths.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,230

“backward-integrated design.” First, you identify your goals. Second, you figure out how you’d assess whether students had hit those goals. Third, you design activities that would prepare students to excel at those assessments.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,259
Now put yourself in Palmer’s shoes. He knows professors are approaching curriculum design the wrong way, and he has a solution for them (backward-integrated design). If he pitched the virtues of the solution, that would make him, in essence, a salesman for backward-integrated design.

But how do audiences respond to sales pitches? With skepticism. We quibble and challenge and question.

If Palmer wants to persuade the professors, he needs them to trip over the truth. And that starts with a focus on the problem, not the solution.

More than thirty years later, Michael Dinneen looks back on that night as one of the defining moments of his life. It was the first time he had lost a patient.6 But what sticks with him nearly as much is what the night taught him about himself: I can endure.

“If we had nothing to tell him, he’d be disappointed,” Blakely said. “The logic seems counterintuitive, but it worked beautifully. He knew that many people become paralyzed by the fear of failure. They’re constantly afraid of what others will think if they don’t do a great job and, as a result, take no risks. My father wanted us to try everything and feel free to push the envelope. His attitude taught me to define failure as not trying something I want to do instead of not achieving the right outcome.” His question, “What did you guys fail at this week?” was a push to stretch. It was an attempt to normalize failure, to make it part of a casual dinner conversation. Because when you seek out situations where you might fail, failure loses some of its menace. You’ve been inoculated against it.

By using Kamb’s level-up strategy, we multiply the number of motivating milestones we encounter en route to a goal. That’s a forward-looking strategy:
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,890
We’re anticipating moments of pride ahead. But the opposite is also possible: to surface those milestones you’ve already met but might not have noticed.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,921
A numerical goal plus supporting plans. Notice what that combination leaves us with: A destination that is not inherently motivating and that lacks meaningful milestones along the way. As a result, achieving the “20 by 2020” goal
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,925
We should be careful that we don’t let this corporate style of goal-setting infiltrate our personal lives, where we’re in full control. “I’m going to lose 10 pounds in 2 months,” for instance, is a classic corporate goal: arbitrary, numerical, and lacking intermediate milestones.

By now, you know what to do: Restore the milestones. Level up: Go one week straight without using the elevator. Pick out 2 microbrews to enjoy on Saturday after a full week without booze. If I jog continuously for three songs on my playlist, that entitles me to download three new ones. And so on.

The same logic applies to milestones involving less tangible goals, such as building leadership
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,944
skills. In most organizations, the only clear “levels” en route to leadership positions are promotions. But what if it takes five years for an employee to earn a promotion, or what if she is not interested in or suited for a promotion? How do you create the intermediate milestones that could provide moments of pride?
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,958
Hitting a milestone sparks pride. It should also spark a celebration—a moment of elevation. (Don’t forget that milestones, along with pits and transitions, are three natural defining moments that deserve extra attention.) Milestones deserve peaks.

“From my experience, the most common trait you will consistently observe in accomplished people is an obsession with completion.6 Once a project falls into their horizon, they crave almost compulsively, to finish it.”

What milestones do is compel us to make that push, because (a) they’re within our grasp, and (b) we’ve chosen them precisely because they’re worth reaching for. Milestones define moments that are conquerable and worth conquering. A Boy Scout spends one more

The military understands this concept well. As the psychologist S. J. Rachman wrote in a report on military training, “What might be called ‘training for courage’ plays an important part in preparing people to undertake dangerous jobs such as fire-fighting or parachuting.”

His workshops weren’t just about toughening up emotionally. They were about mental rehearsals.

Participants had to anticipate how they would react to certain situations. In a sense, they were preloading a response so that, in the moment, they could act quickly without deliberation.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,119
The psychologist Peter Gollwitzer has studied the way this preloading affects our behavior. His research shows that when people make advance mental commitments—if X happens, then I will do Y—they are substantially more likely to act in support of their goals than people who lack those mental plans.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,123
Gollwitzer calls these plans “implementation intentions,”
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,124
and often the trigger for the plan is as simple as a time and place: When I leave work today, I’m going to drive straight to the gym. The success rate is striking.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,125
Setting implementation intentions more than doubled the number of students who turned in a certain assignment on time; doubled the number of women who performed breast self-exams in a certain month; and cut by half the recovery time required by patients who had received hip or knee replacement (among many other examples). There is power in preloading a response.

Responsiveness encompasses three things: Understanding: My partner knows how I see myself and what is important to me. Validation: My partner respects who I am and what I want. Caring: My partner takes active and supportive steps in helping me meet my needs.

You are not special. You’re a number. Analysts at the Corporate Executive Board (CEB) studied customer service calls and the ratings that customers provided afterward.

Over time I learned that getting more out of life wasn’t just a matter of working harder at it. It was much more a matter of working effectively, because working effectively could increase my capacity by hundreds of times. I don’t care what you want or how hard you want to work for it. That’s for you to decide. I’m just trying to pass along to you what has helped me get the most out of each hour of time and each unit of effort.

If you’re like most people, you have no clue how other people see things and aren’t good at seeking to understand what they are thinking, because you’re too preoccupied with telling them what you yourself think is correct.

In other words, you are closed-minded; you presume too much.

Differences in thinking can be symbiotic and complementary instead of disruptive. For example, the lateral approach to thinking common among creative people can lead them to be unreliable, while more linear thinkers are often more dependable; some people are more emotional while others are more logical, and so on. None of these individuals would be able to succeed at any kind of complex project without the help of others who have complementary strengths.

Once I understood that it’s all physiological, many things became clearer to me. While I used to get angry and frustrated at people because of the choices they made, I came to realize that they weren’t intentionally acting in a way that seemed counterproductive; they were just living out things as they saw them, based on how their brains worked.

For example, a highly creative, goal-oriented person good at imagining new ideas might undervalue the minutiae of daily life, which is also important; he might be so driven in his pursuit of long-term goals that he might have disdain for people who focus on the details of daily life. Similarly, a task-oriented person who is great with details might undervalue creativity—and worse still, may squelch it in the interests of efficiency.

If you do just about anything frequently enough over time, you will form a habit that will control you. Good habits are those that get you to do what your “upper-level you” wants, and bad habits are those that are controlled by your “lower-level you” and stand in the way of your getting what your “upper-level you” wants.

Planning vs. perceiving. Some people like to live in a planned, orderly way and others prefer flexibility and spontaneity.35 Planners (or “Judgers” in Myers-Briggs terms) like to focus on a plan and stick with it, while perceivers are prone to focus on what’s happening around them and adapt to it. Perceivers work from the outside in; they see things happening and work backward to understand the cause and how to respond; they also see many possibilities that they compare and choose from—often so many that they are confused by them. In contrast, planners work from the inside out, first figuring out what they want to achieve and then how things should unfold. Planners and perceivers have trouble appreciating each other. Perceivers see new things and change direction often. This is discomforting to planners, who weigh precedent much more heavily in their decision making, and assume if it was done in a certain way before, it should be done in the same way again. Similarly, planners can discomfort perceivers by being seemingly rigid and slow to adapt.

Practical Thinker + Determined. I’ve found that shapers tend to share attributes such as intense curiosity and a compulsive need to make sense of things, independent thinking that verges on rebelliousness, a need to dream big and unconventionally, a practicality and determination to push through all obstacles to achieve their goals, and a knowledge of their own and others’ weaknesses and strengths so they can orchestrate teams to achieve them. Perhaps even more importantly, they can hold conflicting thoughts simultaneously and look at them from different angles. They typically love to knock things around with other really smart people and can easily navigate back and forth between the big picture and the granular details, counting both as equally important.

Think about accuracy, not implications. It’s often the case that someone receiving critical feedback gets preoccupied with the implications of that feedback instead of whether it’s true. This is a mistake. As I’ll explain later, conflating the “what is” with the “what to do about it” typically leads to bad decision making.

Learn from success as well as from failure. Radical truth doesn’t require you to be negative all the time. Point out examples of jobs done well and the causes of their success. This reinforces the actions that led to the results and creates role models for those who are learning.

Knowing how people operate and being able to judge whether that way of operating will lead to good results is more important than knowing what they did. Knowing what people are like is the best indicator of how well they are likely to handle their responsibilities in the future. At Bridgewater, we call this “paying more attention to the swing than the shot.” Since good and bad outcomes can arise from circumstances that might not have had anything to do with how the individual handled the situation, it is preferable to assess people based on both their reasoning and their outcomes.

“Did I understand correctly that you are saying that …?” the other side will realize that they are not just killing time, not just going through a routine. They will also feel the satisfaction of being heard and understood. It has been said that the cheapest concession you can make to the other side is to let them know they have been heard.

Many consider it a good tactic not to give the other side’s case too much attention, and not to admit any legitimacy in their point of view. A good negotiator does just the reverse. Unless you acknowledge what they are saying and demonstrate that you understand them, they may believe you have not heard them.

Speak about yourself, not about them. In many negotiations, each side explains and condemns at great length the motivations and intentions of the other side. It is more persuasive, however, to describe a problem in terms of its impact on you than in terms of what they did or why: “I feel let down” instead of “You broke your word.” “We feel discriminated against” rather than “You’re a racist.”

For a wise solution reconcile interests, not positions This story is typical of many negotiations. Since the parties’ problem appears to be a conflict of positions, and since their goal is to agree on a position, they naturally tend to think and talk about positions—and in the process often reach an impasse.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 853
Interests define the problem. The basic problem in a negotiation lies not in conflicting positions, but in the conflict between each side’s needs, desires, concerns, and fears. The parties may say:

Reconciling interests rather than compromising between positions also works because behind opposed positions lie many more interests than conflicting ones.

One useful rule of thumb is to give positive support to the human beings on the other side equal in strength to the vigor with which you emphasize the problem. This combination of support and attack may seem inconsistent. Psychologically, it is; the inconsistency helps make it work. A well-known theory of psychology, the theory of cognitive dissonance, holds that people dislike inconsistency and will act to eliminate it.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,070
Fighting hard on the substantive issues increases the pressure for an effective solution; giving support to the human beings on the other side tends to improve your relationship and to increase the likelihood of reaching agreement. It is the combination of support and attack that works; either alone is likely to be insufficient.

Yet all too often negotiators end up like the proverbial children who quarreled over an orange. After they finally agreed to divide the orange in half, the first child took one half, ate the fruit, and threw away the peel, while the other threw away the fruit and used the peel from the second half in baking a cake. All too often negotiators “leave money on the table” — they fail to reach agreement when they might have, or the agreement they do reach could have been better for each side. Too many negotiations end up with half an orange for each side instead of the whole fruit for one and the whole peel for the other. Why?

All available answers appear to lie along a straight line between their position and yours. Often the only creative thinking shown is to suggest splitting the difference.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,097
In most negotiations there are four major obstacles that inhibit the inventing of an abundance of options: (1) premature judgment; (2) searching for the single answer; (3) the assumption of a fixed pie; and (4) thinking that “solving their problem is their problem.”

separate the act of inventing options from the act of judging them; (2) broaden the options on the table rather than look for a single answer; (3) search for mutual gains; and (4) invent ways of making their decisions easy.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,168
If ideas are shot down unless they appeal to all participants, the implicit goal becomes to advance an idea that no one will shoot down. If, on the other hand, wild ideas are encouraged, even those that in fact lie well outside the realm of the possible, the group may generate from these ideas other options that are possible and that no one would previously have considered.

To reduce the risk of appearing committed to any given idea, you can make a habit of advancing at least two alternatives at the same time.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,193
You can also put on the table options with which you obviously disagree. “I could give you the house for nothing, or you could pay me a million dollars in cash for it, or. …” Since you are plainly not proposing either of these ideas, the ones that follow are labeled as mere possibilities, not proposals.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,224
But whether you brainstorm together or not, separating the act of developing options from the act of deciding on them is extremely useful in any negotiation.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,225
Discussing options differs radically from taking positions. Whereas one side’s position will conflict with another’s, options invite other options. The very language you use differs. It consists of questions, not assertions; it is open, not closed: “One option is. … What other options have you thought of?” “What if we agreed to this?” “How about doing it this way?” “How would this work?” “What would be wrong with that?” Invent before you decide.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,230
Even with the best of intentions, participants in a brainstorming session are likely to operate on the assumption that they are really looking for the one best answer,

A brainstorming session frees people to think creatively. Once freed, they need ways to think about their problems and to generate constructive solutions.

The task of inventing options involves four types of thinking.

Three points about shared interests are worth remembering. First, shared interests lie latent in every negotiation.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,341
Ask yourself: Do we have a shared interest in preserving our relationship? What opportunities lie ahead for cooperation and mutual benefit? What costs would we bear if negotiations broke off? Are there common principles, like a fair price, that we both can respect?
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,344
Second, shared interests are opportunities, not godsends. To be of use, you need to make something out of them.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,344
It helps to make a shared interest explicit and to formulate it as a shared goal. In other words, make it concrete and future-oriented.

Dovetail differing interests.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,352
In this case as in many others, a satisfactory agreement is made possible because each side wants different things.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,353
People generally assume that differences between two parties create the problem. Yet differences can also lead to a solution.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,354
Agreement is often based on disagreement. It is as absurd to think, for example, that you should always begin by reaching agreement on the facts as it is for a
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,358
Many creative agreements reflect this principle of reaching agreement through differences. Differences in interests and belief make it possible for an item to be of high benefit to you, yet low cost to the other side. Consider the nursery rhyme:
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,391
Look for items that are of low cost to you and high benefit to them, and vice versa.

Impressed with the merits of their own case, people usually pay too little attention to ways of advancing their case by taking care of interests on the other side.

Your task is to give them not a problem but an answer, to give them not a tough decision but an easy one. It is crucial in that process to focus your attention on the content of the decision itself. That decision is often impeded by uncertainty.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,431
Search for it. Look for a decision or statement that the other side may have made in a similar situation,

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,437
We often try to influence others by threats and warnings of what will happen if they do not decide as we would like. Offers are usually more effective.

If trying to settle differences of interest on the basis of will has such high costs, the solution is to negotiate on some basis independent of the will of either side—that is, on the basis of objective criteria.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,481
In short, the approach is to commit yourself to reaching a solution based on principle, not pressure. Concentrate on the merits of the problem, not the mettle of the parties. Be open to reason, but closed to threats.

This is emphatically not what is meant by principled negotiation. Insisting that an agreement be based on objective criteria does not mean insisting that it be based solely on the criterion you advance.

you should be willing to respond to reasons for applying another standard or for applying a standard differently.

Pressure can take many forms: a bribe, a threat, a manipulative appeal to trust, or a simple refusal to budge. In all these cases, the principled response is the same: invite them to state their reasoning, suggest objective criteria you think apply, and refuse to budge except on this basis. Never yield to pressure, only to principle.

principled negotiation is a dominant strategy over positional bargaining.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,630
Principle serves as your hardhearted partner who will not let you yield to pressure. It is a form of “right makes might.”
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,639
Shifting discussion in a negotiation from the question of what the other side is willing to do to the question of how the matter ought to be decided does not end argument, nor does it guarantee a favorable result. It does, however, provide a strategy you can vigorously pursue without the high costs of positional bargaining.

When you are trying to catch an airplane your goal may seem tremendously important; looking back on it, you see you could have caught the next plane. Negotiation will often present you with a similar situation.

The siren song of “Let’s all agree and put an end to this” becomes persuasive. You may end up with a deal you should have rejected.

Having a bottom line makes it easier to resist pressure and temptations of the moment.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,684
But the protection afforded by adopting a bottom line involves high costs. It limits your ability to benefit from what you learn during negotiation. By definition, a bottom line is a position that is not to be changed.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,686
A bottom line also inhibits imagination. It reduces the incentive to invent a tailor-made solution that would reconcile differing interests in a way more advantageous for both you and them.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,691
this. A bottom line—by its very nature rigid—is almost certain to be too rigid.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,699
Is there an alternative to the bottom line? Is there a measure for agreements that will protect you against both accepting an agreement you should reject and rejecting an agreement you should accept? There is.

The reason you negotiate is to produce something better than the results you can obtain without negotiating.

What is your BATNA—your Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement? That is the standard against which any proposed agreement should be measured.

If you have not thought carefully about what you will do if you fail to reach an agreement, you are negotiating with your eyes closed.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,718
One frequent mistake is psychologically to see your alternatives in the aggregate. You may be telling yourself that if you do not reach agreement on a salary for this job, you could always go to California, or go south, or go back to school, or write, or work on a farm, or live in Paris, or do something else. In your mind you are likely to find the sum of these alternatives more attractive than working for a specific salary in a particular job.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,722
you fail to reach agreement, you will have to choose just one.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,723
In most circumstances, however, the greater danger is that you are too committed to reaching agreement. Not having developed any alternative to a negotiated solution, you are unduly pessimistic about what would happen if negotiations broke off.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,727
You may think to yourself, “Let’s negotiate first and see what happens. If things don’t work out, then I’ll figure out what to do.” But having at least a tentative answer to the question is absolutely essential if you are to conduct your negotiations wisely.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,732
it is useful to identify one far from perfect agreement that is better than your BATNA.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,741
In fact, the relative negotiating power of two parties depends primarily upon how attractive to each is the option of not reaching agreement.

Think for a moment about how you would feel walking into a job interview with no other job offers—only some uncertain leads. Think how the talk about salary would go. Now contrast that with how you would feel walking in with two other job offers. How would that salary negotiation proceed? The difference is power.

because they were not converted into a good BATNA, proved of little use. Having an attractive BATNA, the small town had more ability to affect the outcome of the negotiation than did one of the world’s largest corporations.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,763
Vigorous exploration of what you will do if you do not reach agreement can greatly strengthen your hand. Attractive alternatives are not just sitting there waiting for you; you usually have to develop them.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,764
(1) inventing a list of actions you might conceivably take if no agreement is reached; (2) improving some of the more promising ideas and converting them into practical alternatives; and (3) selecting, tentatively, the one alternative that seems best.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,770
The second stage is to improve the best of your ideas and turn the most promising into real alternatives.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,777
Having gone through this effort, you now have a BATNA.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,777
Judge every offer against it. The better your BATNA, the greater your ability to improve the terms of any negotiated agreement.

It is easier to break off negotiations if you know where you’re going. The

If they think you lack a good alternative when in fact you have one, then you should almost certainly let them know.

Developing your BATNA is perhaps the most effective course of action you can take in dealing with a seemingly more powerful negotiator.

If the other side announces a firm position, you may be tempted to criticize and reject it. If they criticize your proposal, you may be tempted to defend it and dig yourself in.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,827
If they attack you, you may be tempted to defend yourself and counterattack. In short, if they push you hard, you will tend to push back.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,834
Break the vicious cycle by refusing to react. Instead of pushing back, sidestep their attack and deflect it against the problem.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,836
Rather than resisting their force, channel it into exploring interests, inventing options for mutual gain, and searching for independent standards.

turn the situation around and ask for their advice. Ask them what they would do if they were in your position.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,882
Recast an attack on you as an attack on the problem. When the other side attacks you personally — as frequently happens — resist the temptation to defend yourself or to attack them. Instead, sit back and allow them to let off steam.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,883
Listen to them, show you understand what they are saying,
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,887
Ask questions and pause. Those engaged in negotiation jujitsu use two key tools. The first is to use questions instead of statements.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,888
Statements generate resistance, whereas questions generate answers.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,893
Silence is one of your best weapons. Use it. If they have made an unreasonable proposal or an attack you regard as unjustified, the best thing to do may be to sit there and not say a word.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,894
If you have asked an honest question to which they have provided an insufficient answer, just wait. People tend to feel uncomfortable with silence, particularly if they have doubts about the merits of something they have said.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,899
Silence often creates the impression of a stalemate that the other side will feel impelled to break by answering your question or coming up with a new suggestion.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,900
When you ask questions, pause. Don’t take them off the hook by going right on with another question or some comment of your own. Some of the most effective negotiating you will ever do is when you are not talking.

The essence of principled negotiation lies in remaining open to persuasion by objective facts and principles.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,000
Making yourself open to correction and persuasion is a pillar in the strategy of principled negotiation. You can convince the other side to be open to the principles and objective standards you suggest only if you show yourself open to the ones they suggest.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,002
“We appreciate what you’ve done for us”

“We have nothing against you personally. We think you’re a generous person.” He puts himself on her side. He defuses any threat she may feel to her self-image.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,008
Praise and support, moreover, imply that the person will continue to deserve them. After being praised, Mrs. Jones now has a slight emotional investment in Turnbull’s approval of her.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,011
“Our concern is fairness”
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,014
Turnbull takes a basic stand on principle and announces his intention to stick to it;
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,015
he must be persuaded on the basis of principle. At the same time, he lets Mrs. Jones know he is open to persuasion along the lines of this principle. She is thus left with little choice but to reason with him in pursuit of her interests.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,018
His ends, he claims, are a fair balance between rent paid and time spent.

“We would like to settle this on the basis of independent standards, not of who can do what to whom”
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,035
But instead of reacting, Turnbull keeps his temper and brings the negotiation back to the merits. This is a good example of negotiation jujitsu. He deflects Mrs. Jones’s attack by taking responsibility for her mistaken perceptions, and he tries to persuade her of his sincere interest in principle.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,037
He does not hide either his selfish interests or his leverage over her; on the contrary, he makes both explicit. Once they are acknowledged, he can distinguish them from the merits and they can cease being an issue.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,047
however, by expressing his gratitude once more and then defining the question of trust as irrelevant. Turnbull at once reaffirms his appreciation of Mrs. Jones while he remains firm on the principle. In doing so, he avoids connecting the two thoughts with “but,” implicitly using “and” instead. “But,” sometimes called the “great eraser,” has a tendency to negate the first thing you say by implying that only one of two statements can be true, making it either/or. “And” underscores the more complex reality that both thoughts can be true at the same time.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,065
Analysis. Statements of fact can feel lecturing or threatening. Whenever you can, ask a question instead.
                
Note:important

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,069
Phrasing each piece of information as a question allows Mrs. Jones to participate, listen to the information, evaluate it, and either accept or correct it.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,070
Turnbull communicates the same information to her but in a less provocative manner. He reduces the heat still further by attributing a particularly pointed question to his absent roommate.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,076
A principled negotiator neither accepts nor rejects the other side’s positions.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,076
To keep the dialogue focused on the merits, Turnbull questions Mrs. Jones about the reasons for her position. He does not ask whether there were any reasons. He assumes there are good reasons. This flattering assumption leads the other side to search for reasons even if there are none, thus keeping the negotiation on the basis of principle.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,086
Analysis. Principled negotiation requires good communication. Before responding to Mrs. Jones’s arguments, Turnbull restates to her in positive terms what he has heard to make sure he has indeed understood her.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,087
Once she feels understood, she can relax and discuss the problem constructively.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,088
She can’t dismiss his arguments on the grounds that they do not take into account what she knows. She is more likely to listen now and be more receptive. In trying to sum up her point of view, Turnbull establishes a cooperative game in which both are making sure he understands the facts.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,093
Analysis. A good negotiator rarely makes an important decision on the spot. The psychological pressure to be nice and to give in is too great. A little time and distance help disentangle the people from the problem.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,097
He shows not only decisiveness but also control over the course of the negotiation.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,103
Turnbull: Let me show you where I have trouble following some of your reasons for the extra $268 a month.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,108
Analysis. In principled negotiation you present your reasons first before offering a proposal. If principles come afterward, they appear not as the objective criteria that any proposal should satisfy but as mere justifications for an arbitrary position.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,110
For Turnbull to explain his reasons first shows his openness to persuasion and his awareness of the need to convince Mrs. Jones. If he announced his proposal first, Mrs. Jones probably would not bother to listen to the reasons that followed. Her mind would be elsewhere, considering what objections and counterproposals she could make.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,114
In preparing for your negotiation, it helps to think about what standards would be useful, who might be able to provide them, and how to frame your questions to elicit the most relevant information.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,116
“One fair solution might be …”
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,120
Analysis. Turnbull presents a proposal not as his, but as a fair option that deserves their joint consideration.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,120
He does not claim it is the only fair solution, but one fair solution. He is specific without digging himself into a position and inviting rejection.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,127
Turnbull is trying to make it easy for Mrs. Jones to say yes to his proposal. So he starts by making it clear that all it takes for the problem to go away is Mrs. Jones’s agreement.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,130
without upsetting the negotiations? He bases the alternative on objective principle by attributing it to a legal authority—the hearing examiner.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,131
He distances himself personally from the suggestion.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,144
Incorporating her interests into the agreement not only gives her more of a stake in it but also allows Mrs. Jones to save face.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,148
Paul and I do appreciate, Mrs. Jones, all that you’ve done for us, and I’m pleased that we’ve settled this last problem fairly and amicably.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,194
Don’t attack people personally for using a tactic you consider illegitimate. If they get defensive it may be more difficult for them to give up the tactic, and they may be left with a residue of anger that will fester and interfere with other issues.

expected. In contrast, looking behind positions for interests, inventing options for mutual gain, and finding and using objective criteria take hard work and, when the other side seems recalcitrant, emotional restraint and maturity.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,461
How complex are the issues? The more complex the subject matter, the more unwise it is to engage in positional bargaining. Complexity calls for careful analysis of interests that are shared or that can be creatively dovetailed, and then for brainstorming.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,463
How important is it to maintain a good working relationship? If the other side is a valued customer or client, maintaining your ongoing relationship may be more important to you than the outcome of any one deal. This does not mean you should be less persistent in pursuing your interests, but it does suggest avoiding tactics such as threats or ultimatums that involve a high
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,482
Bargaining over positions does the least harm if it comes after you have identified each other’s interests, invented options for mutual gain, and discussed relevant standards of fairness.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,486
Yet using external standards improves on haggling in three ways: An outcome informed even by conflicting standards of fairness and community practice is likely to be wiser than an arbitrary result.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,506
Using external standards often helps narrow the range of disagreement and may help expand the area of potential agreement.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,527
Many negotiators are overly optimistic in assuming that they are more clever than their counterparts.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,548
The human propensity for defensive and reactive behavior is one reason so many negotiations fail when agreement would otherwise make sense.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,551
The more seriously you disagree with someone, the more important it is that you be able to deal well with that disagreement.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,561
Rather, substantive issues need to be disentangled from relationship and process issues. The content of a possible agreement needs to be separated from questions of how you talk about it and how you deal with the other side. Each set of issues needs to be negotiated on its own merits. The following list illustrates the distinction: Substantive Issues Terms Conditions Prices Dates Numbers Liabilities Relationship Issues Balance of emotion and reason Ease of communication Degree of trust and reliability Attitude of acceptance (or rejection) Relative emphasis on persuasion (or coercion) Degree of mutual understanding People often assume that there is a trade-off between pursuing a good substantive outcome and pursuing a good relationship. We disagree. A good working relationship tends to make it easier to get good substantive outcomes (for both sides). Good substantive outcomes tend to make a good relationship even better.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,575
Our point is that you should not give in for the purpose of trying to improve a relationship.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,587
Our behavior should be designed to model and encourage the behavior we would prefer and to avoid any reward for the behavior we dislike, both without compromising our substantive interests.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,600
It is the perception that is skewed, not the response to that perception.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,601
On the other hand, if you inquire empathetically, taking their feelings seriously and trying to trace their reasoning to its roots, it is sometimes possible to effect change.

Working with them, you may discover a logical leap, a factual misperception, or a traumatic association from an earlier time that, once brought to light, can be examined and modified by the people themselves.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,604
In essence, you are looking for the psychological interests behind their position, to help them find a way to meet more of their interests more effectively.
                

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,656
A key point, worth repeating, is that negotiating does not require compromising your principles. More often success is achieved by finding a solution that is arguably consistent with each side’s principles.

The Fortune-Teller. Just like a fortune-teller looking in a crystal ball to predict the future, some interviewers like to ask their candidates to look into the future regarding the job at hand by asking hypothetical questions: “What would you do? How would you do it? Could you do it?” Fifty years of academic literature on interview methods makes a strong case against using these types of questions during interviews.

The overwhelming evidence from our field interviews is that ads are a good way to generate a tidal wave of resumes, but a lousy way to generate the right flow of candidates.

Of all the ways to source candidates, the number one method is to ask for referrals from your personal and professional networks. This approach may feel scary and timeconsuming, but it is the single most effective way to find potential A Players.

names. Ryan captures those names on a list, and he makes a point of calling a few new people from his list every week. Then he stays in touch with those who seem to have the most promise.

no time you will have moved into many other networks and enriched your personal talent pool with real ability. But don’t stop there. Bring your broader business contacts in on the hunt, too. Ask your customers for the names of the most talented salespeople who call on them.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 51
Ask your business partners who they think are the most effective business developers. Do the same with your suppliers to identify their strongest purchasing agents. Join professional organizations and ask the people you meet through events. People you interact with every day are

The conversation does not have to be long. We frequently begin with something simple like, “Sue recommended that you and I connect. I understand you are great at what you do. I am always on the lookout for talented people and would love the chance to get to know you. Even if you are perfectly content in your current job, I’d love to introduce myself and hear about your career interests.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 61
Most people will be thrilled to chat. Done well, you will find you can connect with forty or more new people per year.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 61
One more thing. When you are done with the call, assuming you were even moderately impressed with what you heard, be sure to ask the key follow-up question: “Now that you know a little about me, who are the most talented people you know who might be a good fit for my company?”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 71
Ideally, a candidate will share career goals that match your company’s needs. If he or she lacks goals or sounds like an echo of your own Web site, screen the person out. You are done with the call. Talented people know what they want to do and are not afraid to tell you about it.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 72
you still find yourself struggling, we recommend that you put the fear of the reference check into the person. You say, “If you advance to the next step in our process, we will ask for your help in setting up some references with bosses, peers, and subordinates. Okay?” The candidate will say, “Okay.” Then you say, “So I’m curious. What do you think they will say are some things you are not good at, or not interested
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 72
in?” Now you’ll get an honest and full answer.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 72
The thought that you will be talking to references and verifying the candidate’s answers compels the candidate to be much more truthful and complete than usual. You will be amazed how much of a truth serum this technique can be at this stage of the screening interview.

What Brad Smart discovered was the power of using data and patterns of behavior for making predictions about how somebody is likely

“The patterns become clearer and clearer,” he told us, “so it becomes easy to get a fix on exactly what the individual’s strengths and weaknesses are today. It discloses the likelihood that a person will
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 81
minimize weaker points. If the pattern is there of extracting success out of the jaws of defeat, that makes you want to hire somebody.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 83
This is where you will hear the stories behind the polished statements on a resume. In our experience, most
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 84
candidates naturally focus on what really mattered to them at that time in their career rather than regurgitate what they put on their resume.

A Players tend to talk about outcomes linked to expectations. B and C Players talk generally about events, people they met, or aspects of the job they liked without ever getting into results.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 84
Our recommendation is to reframe the question over and over until the candidate gets the message. “What went really wrong? What was your biggest mistake? What would you have done differently? What part of the job did you not like? In what ways were
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 84
your peers stronger than you?” Don’t let the candidate off the hook. Keep pushing until the candidate shares the lows.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 85
Begin by asking candidates for their boss’s name. Ask them to spell it for you, and make a point to show them you are writing it down.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 85
“John Smith, you say? That is S, M, I, T, H, right?” Forcing candidates to spell the name out no matter how common it might be sends a powerful message: you are going to call, so they should tell the truth.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 85
Now ask, “What will Mr. Smith say were your biggest strengths and areas for improvement?” Be sure to say will, not would.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 88
A Players are highly valued by their bosses. B and C Players often are not.

You will have to interrupt the candidate at least once every three or four minutes, so get ready.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 95
The good way to interrupt somebody is to smile broadly, match their enthusiasm level, and use reflective listening to get them to stop talking without demoralizing them. You say, “Wow! It sounds like that pig farm next to the corporate office smelled horrible!” The candidate nods and says “Yes!” and appreciates your empathy and respect. Then you immediately say, “You were just telling me about

People who perform well are generally pulled to greater opportunities. People who perform poorly are often pushed out of their jobs. Do not hire anybody who has been pushed out of 20 percent or more of their jobs. From our experience, those folks have a three times higher chance of being a chronic B or C Player.

Conduct a Who Interview of one and a half to three hours by walking chronologically through a candidate’s career, using the same five questions for each job or chapter in the person’s work history. The hiring manager and one other colleague should conduct the interview in tandem. 3. FOCUSED INVERVIEW(S): Involve others in the hiring process by assigning team members to conduct interviews that focus on the outcomes and/or competencies on the scorecard. 4. CANDIDATE DISCUSSION: Following each day of interviews, grade the scorecard using the skill-will framework. Advance those whose skill (what they are fundamentally good at doing) and will (what they want to do, and in what type of culture) match the mission, outcomes, and competencies on your scorecard.

In the end, this marriage was saved—only because the couple learned to respond to each other not with angry labels, but with helpful actions. One day, when Karen was swamped with work, Ted came home to a messy house.

He was offering Karen support rather than judgment.

What allowed me to take that first step, to choose growth and risk rejection? In the fixed mindset, I had needed my blame and bitterness. It made me feel more righteous, powerful, and whole than thinking I was at fault. The growth mindset allowed me to give up the blame and move on. The growth mindset gave me a mother.

In a relationship, the growth mindset lets you rise above blame, understand the problem, and try to fix it—together.

Shyness harmed the social interactions of people with the fixed mindset but did not harm the social relations of people with the growth mindset.

In our study, the students with the growth mindset were not as prone to see the bullying as a reflection of who they were.

but hopeful of forgiving, learning, and moving on? Think of the worst rejection you ever had. Get in touch with all the feelings, and see if you can view it from a growth mindset. What did you learn from it? Did it teach you something about what you want and don’t want in your life? Did it teach you some positive things that were useful in later relationships? Can you forgive that person and wish them well? Can you let go of the bitterness?

Are you a blamer like me? It’s not good for a relationship to pin everything on your partner. Create your own Maurice and blame him instead. Better yet, work toward curing yourself of the need to blame. Move beyond thinking about fault and blame all the time. Think of me trying to do that too.

Are you shy? Then you really need the growth mindset. Even if it doesn’t cure your shyness, it will help keep it from messing up your social interactions. Next time you’re venturing into a social situation, think about these things: how social skills are things you can improve and how social interactions are for learning and enjoyment, not judgment. Keep practicing this.

There are some people who are born smart in math and everything is easy for them. Then there are the rest of you.

The night before each test, her parents, seeing how distraught she was, tried to build her confidence. “Look, you know how smart you are and we know how smart you are. You’ve got this nailed. Now, stop worrying.” They were as supportive as they knew how to be, but they were raising the stakes even higher. What could they have said instead? “It must be a terrible thing to feel that everyone is evaluating you and you can’t show what you know. We want you to know that we are not evaluating you. We care about your learning, and we know that you’ve learned your stuff. We’re proud that you’ve stuck to it and kept learning.”

One of Marva Collins’s first mentors taught her the same thing—that, above all, a good teacher is one who continues to learn along with the students.

I can learn all the time.”

Think of something you need to do, something you want to learn, or a problem you have to confront. What is it? Now make a concrete plan. When will you follow through on your plan? Where will you do it? How will you do it? Think about it in vivid detail.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 228
These concrete plans—plans you can visualize—about when, where, and how you are going to do something lead to really high levels of follow-through, which, of course, ups the chances of success. So the idea is not only to make a growth-mindset plan, but also to visualize, in a concrete way, how you’re going to carry it out.

These make for smoother sailing: (1) Peanut shell sling in black fleece—it’s more comfy than the cotton and you can pop baby in and out wherever you are, from birth to 35 lbs. I never take mine off, it’s part of my outfit; (2) Peapod plus portable tent—this is baby’s main bed at home and travel so baby has the same sleep place everywhere we go, and the flaps give all travel parties privacy—great from small babies to five-year-olds. I can still jam this onto a little wheeled carry-on and

pack mine and baby’s minimal clothing around it; (3) Go Go Kidz TravelMate (great for wheeling car seat up to the gate for gate check or use on plane); (4) Britax Diplomat car seat is small but kids can use it from birth to approx. four years old. Make sure the wheeled carry-on bag you get is one size smaller than the allowed carry-on size so you don’t get bumped to check the bag in if the plane is full. You can always nicely argue/reason/bat your eyelashes that you will put the bag in your foot space. Also, very helpful to give baby something to sip or munch on during takeoff and landing so yours isn’t the baby screaming from ear pain. Happy travels!

WHAT YOU TRACK DETERMINES YOUR LENS—CHOOSE CAREFULLY “Those of us who are lucky enough to live in a world where we have enough and we have a roof and we have food—we find ourselves caught in this cycle of keeping track of the wrong things. Keeping track of how many times we’ve been rejected. Keeping track of how many times it didn’t work. Keeping track of all the times someone has broken our heart or double-crossed us or let us down. Of course, we can keep track of those things, but why? Why keep track of them? Are they making us better? “Wouldn’t it make more sense to keep track of the other stuff? To keep track of all the times it worked? All the times we took a risk? All the times we were able to brighten someone else’s day? When we start doing that, we can redefine ourselves as people who are able to make an impact on the world. It took me a bunch of cycles to figure out that the narrative was up to me. “If a narrative isn’t working, well then, really, why are you using it?

Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence, or a vice: It is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets. The space and quiet that idleness provides is a necessary condition for standing back from life and seeing it whole, for making unexpected connections and waiting for the wild summer lightning strikes of inspiration—it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done. “Idle dreaming is often the essence of what we do,” writes Thomas Pynchon in his essay on Sloth.

The reason for Tolkien’s mistake, since you ask, is that adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that word order in the slightest you’ll sound like a maniac. It’s an odd thing that every English speaker uses that list, but almost none of us could write it out. And as size comes before colour, green great dragons can’t exist.

No matter what anyone does, no matter what situation takes place, you won’t even feel the tendency to close. You will just embrace life with all your heart and soul.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 48
As long as you are defining what you like and what you don’t like, you will open and close. You are actually defining your limits. You are allowing your mind to create triggers that open and close you.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 48
Let go of that. Dare to be different. Enjoy all of life.

Life must now compete with this blocked event for your attention, and the impression does not just sit in there quietly.

In the yogic tradition, that unfinished energy pattern is called a Samskara. This is a Sanskrit word meaning “impression,” and in the yogic teachings it is considered one of the most important influences affecting your life. A Samskara is a blockage, an impression from the past. It’s an unfinished energy pattern that ends up running your life.

The alternative is to be willing to let it go when it gets stimulated. It only hurts for a minute and then it’s over.

Because most of us don’t have to worry about food, clothing, or shelter, we have the luxury of worrying about a spot on our pants, or laughing too loud, or saying something wrong. Because we’ve developed this hypersensitive psyche, we constantly use our energies to close around it and protect ourselves. But this process only hides the problems; it doesn’t fix them. You’re locking your illness inside yourself,
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 61
if you protect yourself, you will never be free. It’s that simple.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 62
Once you close, you have to make sure that what you protected doesn’t get disturbed. You then carry this task for the rest of your life.

day. How often do you find yourself trying to protect and defend that weak part of you? You feel like the world wants to get right at it.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 62
The reward for not protecting your psyche is liberation. You are free to walk through this world without a problem

You are just having fun experiencing whatever happens next.

disturbed. You no longer have to listen to “What will they think of me?” or, “Oh God, I wish I hadn’t said that. It sounded so stupid.”

Spiritual growth is about the point at which you start to feel your energy change.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 62
For instance, somebody says something, and you start to feel the energy get a little strange inside. You will actually start to feel a tightening. That is your cue that it’s time to grow. It’s not time to defend yourself, because you don’t want the part of you that you would be defending.

This technique of freeing yourself is done with the understanding that thoughts and emotions are just objects of consciousness.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 64
consciousness. If you want to be free, then every time you feel any change in the energy flow, relax behind it. Don’t fight with it, don’t try to change it, and don’t judge it. Don’t say, “Oh, I can’t believe I’m still feeling this. I promised myself I wouldn’t think about that car anymore.” Don’t do that; you’ll just end up going with the guilt thoughts instead of the car thoughts. You have to let them all go.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 65
Only you can take inner freedom away from yourself, or give it to yourself. Nobody else can.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 71
If you have a lot of fear, you won’t like change. You’ll try to create a world around you that is predictable, controllable, and definable. You’ll try to create a world that doesn’t stimulate your fears. Fear doesn’t want to feel itself; it’s actually afraid of itself.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 71
You can do one of two things with fear: you can recognize that you have it and work to release it, or you can keep it and try to hide from

Your definitions of desirable and undesirable, as well as good and bad, all come about because you have defined how things need to be in order for you to be okay.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 72
As you grow spiritually, you will realize that your attempts to protect yourself from your problems actually create more problems.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 73
When your heart is weak it becomes susceptible to lower vibrations, and one of the lowest of all vibrations is fear. Fear is the cause of every problem. It’s the root of all prejudices and the negative emotions of anger, jealousy, and possessiveness.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 73
You’d be willing to face everything and everyone because you wouldn’t have fear inside of you that could cause you disturbance.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 73
The purpose of spiritual evolution is to remove the blockages that cause your fear.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 74
Everyone is saying, “I will do every single thing I can to keep my stuff. If you say anything that disturbs me, I will defend myself. I’ll yell at you and make you take it back. If you cause any disturbance inside of me, I will make you so sorry.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 74
again. First you defend yourself, and then you protect yourself. You do whatever you can to keep from feeling disturbance.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 74
You only have to be willing to open your heart in the face of anything and everything, and permit the purification process to take place.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 76
Your consciousness leaves the centered position of witnessing the many energies around you, and you get sucked into focusing on just one of them.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 76
Things you liked, now look dark and depressing. But nothing has really changed. It’s just that you’re looking at life from that seat of disturbance.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 80
So don’t fall. Let go. No matter what it is, let it go. The bigger it is, the higher the reward of letting go and the worse the fall if you don’t. It’s pretty black-and-white. You either let go or you don’t. There really isn’t anything in between. So let all of your blockages and disturbances become the fuel for the journey. That which is holding you down can become a powerful force

Real transformation begins when you embrace your problems as agents for growth. In order to understand how this process works, let’s examine the following situation.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 88
This is what you begin to experience if you hang out with the Self instead of hanging out with inner disturbances.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 88
Awareness is simply aware while everything in the universe parades before it.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 89
When Buddha said that all of life is suffering, this is what he was referring to. People do not understand how much they are suffering because they have never experienced what it is like to not suffer.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 90
You are either trying to stop suffering, controlling your environment to avoid suffering, or worrying about suffering in the future. This state of affairs is so prevalent that you don’t see it, just as a fish doesn’t see the water.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 91
Inner sensitivity is a symptom of non-well-being. It’s the same as when the body sends pain or displays other symptoms when it’s not well.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 91
Your psyche is communicating through its universal language: fear. Self-consciousness, jealousy, insecurity, anxiety—they are all fear.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 92
What you’ll see is that your mind is always telling you that you have to change something outside in order to solve your inner problems. But if you are wise, you won’t play this game. You’ll realize that the advice your mind is giving you is psychologically damaged advice. Your mind’s thoughts are disturbed by its fears.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 93
The fact is, however, external changes are not going to solve your problem because they don’t address the root of your problem. The root problem is that you don’t feel whole and complete within yourself.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 93
You began with a problem inside yourself, and you tried to solve it by getting involved with somebody else.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 93
Imagine what fun life would be if you didn’t have those neurotic, personal thoughts going on within you. You could enjoy things, and you could actually get to know people instead of needing them.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 93
You could just live and experience your life, instead of trying to use life to fix what’s wrong inside of you. You are capable of achieving that state. It’s never too late.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 95
your mind starts telling you what you have to do to make everything inside okay, don’t buy into what it’s
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 95
The truth is, everything will be okay as soon as you are okay with everything. And that’s the only time everything will be okay.

There are billions of people on this planet, and one of them didn’t say hello to you. Are you saying that you can’t handle that? Is that reasonable?

Begin this journey to freedom by regularly reminding yourself to watch the psyche.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 97
Every time you get into your car, as you’re settling into the seat, just stop. Take a moment to remember that you’re spinning on a planet in the middle of empty space. Then remind yourself that you’re not going to get involved in your own melodrama.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 97
Persistently centered consciousness is the seat of Self.

heart. What is that feeling? Why is that happening? People don’t normally ask why; they just try to keep it from happening.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 101
You must go deeper than that and look at the dynamics of the layers that have been created. At the core there is the pain. Then, in order to avoid the pain, you try to stay busy with friends and hide

sky. You are sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Though you can only see a few thousand stars, there are hundreds of billions of stars in our Milky Way Galaxy alone. In fact, it is estimated that there are over a trillion stars in the Spiral Galaxy.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 102
From that perspective, do you really care what people think about your clothes or your car? Do you really need to feel embarrassed if you forget someone’s name?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 102
To spend your life avoiding pain means it’s always right behind you. At any point you could slip and say the wrong thing. At any point anything can happen. So you end up devoting your life to the avoidance of pain.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 103
In essence, you can simply live your life and experience what it’s like to be on a planet that is spinning around in the middle of nowhere, until you die.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 103
If you want to be free, simply view inner pain as a temporary shift in your energy flow.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 103
You cannot spend your life avoiding things that are not actually happening, or everything will become negative.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 103
Probably more than there are stars in the sky. If you want to grow and be free to explore life, you cannot spend your life avoiding the myriad things that might hurt your heart or mind.

You must look inside yourself and determine that from now on pain is not a problem. It is just a thing in the universe.

with it, you will devote your life to avoiding it. If you feel insecurity, it’s just a feeling. You can handle a feeling. If you feel embarrassed, it’s just a feeling. It’s just a part of creation. If you feel jealousy and your heart burns, just look at it objectively, like you would a mild bruise. It’s a thing in the universe that is passing through your system. Laugh at it, have fun with it, but don’t be afraid of

it. It cannot touch you unless you touch it.

Wise beings do not want to remain a slave to the fear of pain. They permit the world to be what it is instead of being afraid of it. They wholeheartedly participate in life, but not for the purpose of using life to avoid themselves.

You will feel everything at a deeper level. You will begin to have truly beautiful experiences rise up within you. Eventually you will understand that there is an ocean of love behind all of this fear and pain.

Imagine that you found yourself in the midst of an open field where the sun was always shining. It was a beautiful place of great light and great openness.
                
Note:Great analogy

Yellow highlight | Page: 116
It’s not really difficult to get past the walls. Time and again, every day, the natural flow of life collides with our walls and tries to tear them down. But time and again, we defend them. You must realize that when you defend yourself, you are really defending your walls.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 120
Since the analytical mind cannot handle the infinite, you created an alternate reality of finite thoughts that can remain fixed within your mind.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 120
This mental model has become your reality. You must now struggle day and night to make the world fit your model, and you label everything that doesn’t fit as wrong, bad, or unfair.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 120
You get frustrated and angry over simple little things. This is the result of being unable to fit what’s actually happening into your model of reality.

In order to truly go beyond your model, you must first understand why you built it.

If you really want to see why you do things, then don’t do them and see what happens.

The moment somebody starts behaving in a way that is outside your expectations, your mind starts talking. It says, “What should I do about this? I can’t just ignore what he did. I could confront him directly or ask someone else to talk to him.” Your mind is telling you to fix it.
                
Note:fix it in order to fit into your model 

Yellow highlight | Page: 122
This zone is finite. All attempts to stay within it keep you finite. Going beyond always means letting go of the effort to keep things within your defined limits.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 122
In other words, you can devote your whole life to the process of making sure everything fits within your limited model, or you can devote your life to freeing yourself from the limits of your model.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 122
But in truth, the confines of your comfort zone create just such a cage. This inner cage doesn’t limit your body; it limits the expanse of your consciousness.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 122
If you examine this, you will see that you’re willing to stay in this cage because you’re afraid.

They don’t say, “Get me out of here! I’m locked in this tiny world in which everything has to be a certain way. I have to worry about what everybody’s doing, what I look like, and everything I’ve ever said. I want out.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 123
You see that you’re afraid to tell people what you really think. You see that you’re too self-conscious to freely express yourself.

Spirituality begins when you decide that you’ll never stop trying. Spirituality is the commitment to go beyond,

on. The more consciousness narrows its focus onto this mental structure, the greater the tendency to utilize it to define the concept of self.

Who are you that is lost and trying to build a concept of yourself in order to be found?
                
Note:why design a concept of self?

Yellow highlight | Page: 130
You will never find yourself in what you have built to define yourself. You’re the one who’s doing the building.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 130
In this panic, in this lost state, you learned to cling and hold onto the thoughts and emotions that were passing before you. You used them to build a personality, a persona, a self-concept that would allow you to define yourself.

If you get that model down absolutely right, and behave consistently every time, you have actually “created” someone.

aware. If you pass through a period of darkness or depression, just ask, “Who is aware of the darkness?” That’s how you pass through the different stages of your inner growth. You just keep letting go, and remain aware that you are still there.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 136
When you’ve let go of the dark psyche, and you’ve let go of the light psyche, and you’re no longer clinging to anything, you will reach a point where it will all open up behind you.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 136
You will then walk through every moment of your daily life with the flow of this inner force sustaining you,
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 136
You will still have thoughts, emotions, and a self-concept floating around in inner space, but they will be just one small part of what you experience. You will not identify with anything outside the sense of Self.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 143
Events don’t determine whether or not you’re going to be happy. They’re just events. You determine whether or not you’re going to be happy. You can be happy just to be alive. You can be happy having all these things happen to you, and then be happy to die. If you can live this way, your heart will be so open and your Spirit will be so free, that you will soar up to the heavens.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 143
You’re sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Go ahead, take a look at reality. You’re floating in empty space in a universe that goes on forever. If you have to be here, at least be happy and enjoy the experience. You’re going to die anyway. Things are going to happen anyway. Why shouldn’t you be happy?

If you’re neither pushing life away, nor pulling it toward you, then you are not creating any resistance. You are simply present. In this state, you are just witnessing and experiencing the events of life taking place.

your being. It is what makes your arms and legs move. They don’t just move randomly by themselves. They move the way they do because you assert will to make them do so. You use the same will to hold onto thoughts when you want to concentrate on them.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 151
Eventually you’ll see that this resistance is a tremendous waste of energy. The fact is, you’re generally using your will to resist one of two things: that which has already happened or that which hasn’t happened yet.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 151
It is not life’s events that are causing problems or stress. It is your resistance to life’s events that is causing this experience.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 152
This is because we don’t all have the same preconceived notions of how things should be or how much they should matter to us.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 152
If you want to understand stress, begin by realizing that you carry around with you your own set of preconceived notions of how things should be. It is based upon these notions that you assert your will to resist what has already happened. Where did you get these preconceived notions?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 153
begin dealing with each situation with acceptance.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 153
This is because events are not problems; they’re just events. Your resistance to them is what causes the problem. But, again, don’t think that because you
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 153
You will be surprised to find that in most situations there’s nothing to deal with except for your own fears and desires. Fear and desire make everything seem so complicated.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 153
When the events of this world make it through you, you have reached a deep spiritual state. You can then be conscious in the presence of whatever takes place, without building up blocked energies. When you attain that state, everything becomes clear. In contrast, everybody else is attempting to deal with the world around them while struggling with their own reactions and personal preferences. When a person is dealing with their own fears, anxieties, and desires, how much energy is left for dealing with what’s actually happening?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 154
Stop and think about what you’re capable of achieving. Up to now, your capacities have been constrained by constant inner struggles. Imagine what would happen if your awareness was free to focus only on the events actually taking place. You would have no noise going on inside. If you lived like this, you could do anything. Your capabilities would be exponential compared to what you’ve ever experienced. If you could bring this level of awareness and clarity to everything you do, your life would change.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 154
If you’re not trying to make people fit into your preconceived notions of what you like and dislike, you will find that relationships are not really that difficult. If you’re not so busy judging and resisting people based upon what is blocked inside of you, you will find that they are much easier to get along with—and so are you.

Daily work is fun. In fact, it’s easy. Your work is just what you do with yourself during the day while you’re spinning on a planet through empty space. If

Once the personal energies pass through you, the world becomes a different place. People and events will appear different to you. You will realize that you have talents and abilities you never saw before.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 156
This process of relaxing through resistance is beneficial to everything in your life. This is because it directly addresses how to keep your heart open when it is trying to close. Deep inner release is a spiritual path in and of itself.

It’s the work of a lifetime to become that open, that complete, and that whole.

If you relax and release, you will see that it puts you through tremendous spiritual growth.

You truly can reach a state in which you never have any more stress, tension, or problems for the rest of your life. You just have to realize that life is giving you a gift, and that gift is the flow of events that takes place between your birth and your death.

You fear death because you crave life. You fear death because you think there’s something to get that you haven’t experienced yet. Many people feel that death will take something away from them. The wise person realizes that death is constantly giving them something. Death is giving meaning to your life. You’re the one who throws your life away; you waste every second of it.

You don’t feel resentment toward people. You don’t close or get tight as often. Things still happen that you don’t want to happen, but they don’t seem to touch you as much.

As you associate less with the physical and psychological parts of your being, you begin to identify more with the flow of pure energy.

If you were being totally honest, you’d probably say that it’s generally full of complaints and fears. Well, how does Spirit normally feel? The truth is, it always feels good. It always feels high. It always feels open and light.

As you let go and willingly release the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of your being, Spirit becomes your state.

If you feel jealousy and your heart burns, just look at it objectively, like you would a mild bruise. It’s a thing in the universe that is passing through your system. Laugh at it, have fun with it, but don’t be afraid of

it. It cannot touch you unless you touch it.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 104
Wise beings do not want to remain a slave to the fear of pain. They permit the world to be what it is instead of being afraid of it. They wholeheartedly participate in life, but not for the purpose of using life to avoid themselves.

You will feel everything at a deeper level. You will begin to have truly beautiful experiences rise up within you. Eventually you will understand that there is an ocean of love behind all of this fear and pain.

Imagine that you found yourself in the midst of an open field where the sun was always shining. It was a beautiful place of great light and great openness.
                
Note:Great analogy

Yellow highlight | Page: 116
It’s not really difficult to get past the walls. Time and again, every day, the natural flow of life collides with our walls and tries to tear them down. But time and again, we defend them. You must realize that when you defend yourself, you are really defending your walls.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 120
Since the analytical mind cannot handle the infinite, you created an alternate reality of finite thoughts that can remain fixed within your mind.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 120
This mental model has become your reality. You must now struggle day and night to make the world fit your model, and you label everything that doesn’t fit as wrong, bad, or unfair.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 120
You get frustrated and angry over simple little things. This is the result of being unable to fit what’s actually happening into your model of reality.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 120
In order to truly go beyond your model, you must first understand why you built it.

If you really want to see why you do things, then don’t do them and see what happens.

The moment somebody starts behaving in a way that is outside your expectations, your mind starts talking. It says, “What should I do about this? I can’t just ignore what he did. I could confront him directly or ask someone else to talk to him.” Your mind is telling you to fix it.
                
Note:fix it in order to fit into your model 

Yellow highlight | Page: 122
This zone is finite. All attempts to stay within it keep you finite. Going beyond always means letting go of the effort to keep things within your defined limits.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 122
In other words, you can devote your whole life to the process of making sure everything fits within your limited model, or you can devote your life to freeing yourself from the limits of your model.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 122
But in truth, the confines of your comfort zone create just such a cage. This inner cage doesn’t limit your body; it limits the expanse of your consciousness.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 122
If you examine this, you will see that you’re willing to stay in this cage because you’re afraid.

They don’t say, “Get me out of here! I’m locked in this tiny world in which everything has to be a certain way. I have to worry about what everybody’s doing, what I look like, and everything I’ve ever said. I want out.”
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 123
You see that you’re afraid to tell people what you really think. You see that you’re too self-conscious to freely express yourself.

Spirituality begins when you decide that you’ll never stop trying. Spirituality is the commitment to go beyond,

on. The more consciousness narrows its focus onto this mental structure, the greater the tendency to utilize it to define the concept of self.

Who are you that is lost and trying to build a concept of yourself in order to be found?
                
Note:why design a concept of self?

Yellow highlight | Page: 130
You will never find yourself in what you have built to define yourself. You’re the one who’s doing the building.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 130
In this panic, in this lost state, you learned to cling and hold onto the thoughts and emotions that were passing before you. You used them to build a personality, a persona, a self-concept that would allow you to define yourself.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 131
If you get that model down absolutely right, and behave consistently every time, you have actually “created” someone.

It got engrained in you at a very young age,

When your mind is disturbed, don’t ask, “What do I do about this?” Instead ask, “Who am I that notices this?”

aware. If you pass through a period of darkness or depression, just ask, “Who is aware of the darkness?” That’s how you pass through the different stages of your inner growth. You just keep letting go, and remain aware that you are still there.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 136
When you’ve let go of the dark psyche, and you’ve let go of the light psyche, and you’re no longer clinging to anything, you will reach a point where it will all open up behind you.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 136
You will then walk through every moment of your daily life with the flow of this inner force sustaining you,
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 136
You will still have thoughts, emotions, and a self-concept floating around in inner space, but they will be just one small part of what you experience. You will not identify with anything outside the sense of Self.

Events don’t determine whether or not you’re going to be happy. They’re just events. You determine whether or not you’re going to be happy. You can be happy just to be alive. You can be happy having all these things happen to you, and then be happy to die. If you can live this way, your heart will be so open and your Spirit will be so free, that you will soar up to the heavens.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 143
You’re sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Go ahead, take a look at reality. You’re floating in empty space in a universe that goes on forever. If you have to be here, at least be happy and enjoy the experience. You’re going to die anyway. Things are going to happen anyway. Why shouldn’t you be happy?

If you’re neither pushing life away, nor pulling it toward you, then you are not creating any resistance. You are simply present. In this state, you are just witnessing and experiencing the events of life taking place.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 150
your being. It is what makes your arms and legs move. They don’t just move randomly by themselves. They move the way they do because you assert will to make them do so. You use the same will to hold onto thoughts when you want to concentrate on them.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 151
Eventually you’ll see that this resistance is a tremendous waste of energy. The fact is, you’re generally using your will to resist one of two things: that which has already happened or that which hasn’t happened yet.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 151
It is not life’s events that are causing problems or stress. It is your resistance to life’s events that is causing this experience.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 152
This is because we don’t all have the same preconceived notions of how things should be or how much they should matter to us.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 152
If you want to understand stress, begin by realizing that you carry around with you your own set of preconceived notions of how things should be. It is based upon these notions that you assert your will to resist what has already happened. Where did you get these preconceived notions?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 153
begin dealing with each situation with acceptance.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 153
This is because events are not problems; they’re just events. Your resistance to them is what causes the problem. But, again, don’t think that because you
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 153
You will be surprised to find that in most situations there’s nothing to deal with except for your own fears and desires. Fear and desire make everything seem so complicated.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 153
When the events of this world make it through you, you have reached a deep spiritual state. You can then be conscious in the presence of whatever takes place, without building up blocked energies. When you attain that state, everything becomes clear. In contrast, everybody else is attempting to deal with the world around them while struggling with their own reactions and personal preferences. When a person is dealing with their own fears, anxieties, and desires, how much energy is left for dealing with what’s actually happening?
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 154
Stop and think about what you’re capable of achieving. Up to now, your capacities have been constrained by constant inner struggles. Imagine what would happen if your awareness was free to focus only on the events actually taking place. You would have no noise going on inside. If you lived like this, you could do anything. Your capabilities would be exponential compared to what you’ve ever experienced. If you could bring this level of awareness and clarity to everything you do, your life would change.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 154
If you’re not trying to make people fit into your preconceived notions of what you like and dislike, you will find that relationships are not really that difficult. If you’re not so busy judging and resisting people based upon what is blocked inside of you, you will find that they are much easier to get along with—and so are you.

Once the personal energies pass through you, the world becomes a different place. People and events will appear different to you. You will realize that you have talents and abilities you never saw before.

We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread.

Logotherapy deviates from psychoanalysis insofar as it considers man a being whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning, rather than in the mere gratification and satisfaction of drives and instincts, or in merely reconciling the conflicting claims of id, ego and superego, or in the mere adaptation and adjustment to society and environment.

The fear of sleeplessness13 results in a hyper-intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so.

Yellow highlight | Page: 129
the hyper-intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep.

A similar chain of events, however, can be observed in obsessive-compulsive cases in which the patient fights the ideas which haunt him.16 Thereby, however, he increases their power to disturb him, since pressure precipitates counterpressure.
                

Yellow highlight | Page: 131
On the other hand, as soon as the patient stops fighting his obsessions and instead tries to ridicule them by dealing with them in an ironical way—by applying paradoxical intention—the vicious circle is cut, the symptom diminishes and finally atrophies.

As we see, anticipatory anxiety has to be counteracted by paradoxical intention; hyper-intention as well as hyper-reflection have to be counteracted by dereflection;

And this in turn presupposes the human capacity to creatively turn life’s negative aspects into something positive or constructive.

But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.

It is not enough only to be a student at the beginning. It is a position that one has to assume for life. Learn from everyone and everything. From the people you beat, and the people who beat you, from the people you dislike, even from your supposed enemies. At every step and every juncture in life, there is the opportunity to learn—and even if the lesson is purely remedial, we must not let ego block us from hearing it again.
